The earliest verified attempts at xenotransplantation were made as early as the 18th century, and the first dog or cat corneal transplants were unsuccessfully attempted to heal patients who eventually went blind (Ullman, 1902). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines xenotransplantation as “any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source, or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues, or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues, or organs” (U.S. FDA, 2021).<br><br>
Grafts of animal skin tissue were accomplished around the end of the nineteenth century. It was particularly around the early 1900s when the trials multiplied. Mathieu Jaboulay, in 1906, accomplished the first two animal organ transplants on humans. The first patient was a woman who had kidney failure by transplanting. A pig kidney was placed outside the human body, at the bend of the elbow, but the graft did not work. He repeated the experiment a few months later using a goat kidney, which was also a failure. It was then the turn of monkeys reputed to be close to humans to serve as raw material for Serge Voronoff for tissue grafts from their testicles on men in order to restore their vitality. It was then necessary to wait until the beginning of the 1960s for new xenografts to be attempted. (Hamilton, 2012) In 1954, the first human organs successful transplant was from the identical twin brother kidney’s deceased patient Richard Herrick. Previously this would be considered a deadly illness, but with the help of the new transplant the first recipient could live eight more years (Powell, 2011).<br><br> 
From Friday January 7, 2022, a 57-year-old man lived with a genetically modified pig’s heart for two months (Rabin, 2022). The xenotranspla3ntation on this patient was announced Monday, January 10 by a team from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the United States of America. (University of Maryland School, 2022). David Bennett, a sufferer of an end-stage heart failure and arrhythmia, was ineligible for a conventional heart transplant, or even an artificial heart pump system. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore authorised this experimental strategy on a compassionate basis, in this consenting patient and without any other therapeutic option. He became the first human being whose life could have been saved thanks to a xenotransplantation.<br><br>
Nicholas L. Tilney in his book ‘Transplant: From Myth to Reality’ wrote: “When I got here in 1964, the early mortality rate following transplantation was as high as 50 percent. By the end of the year, there were virtually no survivors. Now, if someone dies, it’s a cause of great angst” (Tilney, 2003, p. 86). What kind of questions can the author ask now that with the help of genome editing technologies is it possible to design a molecular fairy-tale in the field of genetic engineering to end the battle of immunological response in organ transplantation and create a personalised bio-formulated and controlled one in a lab?<br><br>
In practise, the pig currently appears to be the most appropriate animal species as a source of cultivation of organs for humans. The porcine species has many advantages in this respect because: Uncontroversial use for the human species; easy breeding; possible to breed germ-free or organ-free animals; suitable size and similar physiology of transplantable organs compared to humans (Klymiuk et al., 2010). The advantages of xenografts appear as a good fit for breeded organs. Xenografts would make it possible to definitively solve the problem of the shortage of organs; they would also bring a radical answer to all the ethical questions relating to the removal of human organs, whether removal from a living donor or from a corpse.<br><br>
Another factor further aggravates the situation. Although very favourable in the short term, the percentage of success of organ transplants gradually decreases over time by the destruction of an increasing proportion of graft; there is an unlimited availability of xenografts; organ transplantation becomes an elective intervention (a controllable / malleable bodily feature); guarantee of organs quality and the use of donors germ-free of specific pathogens.<br><br>
Although it will be important to review, map and understand the technological processes and the scientific processes that xenotransplantation entails, the study problem focuses on the body theme and the ethic-onto-epistemological implications that bio-constructed xenotransplanted bodies can have beyond the human. Hence, my references will not include just science theoretical scholars, but also philosophers, artists and researchers who have analysed these topics from different fields of study.<br><br> 
To relate science socio historical event to artistic practise I will now mention artists from diverse fields that work on topics and create artworks related to body modification, morphological freedom, mutations, and human body (re)design:<br><br> 
Agi Haines’ work is focused on human body speculative design and “the weird and wonderful things that exist inside us” (Haines, n.d). She questions the social response to new bodies that can be seen as malleable material and looks at the human body as a system of interchangeable parts. As you can see in the Figure 2, her artwork ‘​​Circumventive Organs’ (Haines, 2013) refers to a speculative future anatomical lesson or a natural sciences museum. It questions how bioprinting can make it possible for new organs to become a part of our reality:<br><br>
[T]he ability to replicate and print cells in complex structures could mean different cells with various functions could be put together in new ways to create new organs we would take millions of years to evolve naturally. Frankenstein-esque hybrid organs could then be put together using cells from different body parts or even different species. (Haines, n.d.)<br><br>  
Patricia Piccinini’s sculptures make us reimagine our relationship with nature and animals through her art. The display of her artwork ‘The Young Family’ in Figure 3 (Piccinini, 2002) resembles animals that were bred in a laboratory. A chimera who’s new materialisation comes from the combination of creative thinking, speculative design and scientific research. She thinks the body, human and / or animal as an artistic interface and she sculpts “life forms that don’t exist” (Badham, 2017) and envisions a hyper-realistic view of hypothetical hybrid bodies.<br><br>
The Australian performance artist, Stelarc, makes art out of the human body. His project, a combination of divergence of using his body as an artistic tool and interface combining robotics and cybernetics. ‘The Ear of Arm’ (Stelarc, 2008) in Figures 4 and 5 is an example of how a hybrid body can be constructed where he implanted a “third ear” in his forearm that grew in a mouse (Stelarc, n.d.).<br><br> 
This also questions how the body can be cropped into pieces, adding, and subtracting organs, cells, tissues - a body with an interchangeable character. The artist describes the body as a thing that from the biological point is not properly organised and that “[t] he body needs to be Internet enabled in more intimate ways. THE EAR ON ARM project suggests an alternate anatomical architecture - the engineering of a new organ for the body: an available, accessible, and mobile organ for other bodies in other places, enabling people to locate and listen in to another body elsewhere (Stelarc, n.d.).<br><br>
The provocative artist Wim Delvoye began to tattoo live pigs in the 1990s. He began to experiment with tattooing the skin of dead pigs. Seven years later, he transitioned to work with a new material: the skin or pigs that were alive as a canvas for his artworks. He raised the pigs in a farm in the outskirts of Beijing, China and created the concept of art farm, a place where he would develop his artistic practise with the help of veterinarians to put pigs to sleep to be tattooed. As well to take care of the scars and wounds that their skin would suffer from the tattoos (Sweet, n.d).<br><br>
In an interview the artist explained, “I show the world works of art that are so alive, they have to be vaccinated…It lives, it moves, it will die. Everything is real.” (Carpentier, 2012). His work ‘Drawings and Models’ in Figures 6 and 7 questions the value of material, as western inspired drawings made by the artists are placed into a pig’s skin and become a decorative ornament who has no other purpose than to shock. In this respect, these pieces are not just limited to the never-ending question of what art is, but also worth reflecting on the ethical implications of some artistic practises. Is everything acceptable in the name of art?<br><br>
To explore the insides, what scares us in the unknown, the concepts of opening the body, the tangible self, the artist’s Anish Kapoor artworks ‘All inside myself’ (Kapoor, 2012) and ‘Shooting into the Corner’ (Kapoor, 2008-2009) (Kapoor, n.d) are an example of the the eagerness to discover and fantasises about a body without a human body. The material exploration that resembles a quartered body and breaks the bounds between physicality and the limits of the body form and figure.<br><br>
Sarah Sitkin in her artwork ‘Bodysuits’ (Sitkin, 2018) as in Figure 10 uses her special effects materials to create hyper-realistic figures of human torsos that function as a vest that allows you to experience another body. It also questions whether the body somehow defines our identity, making the suit function as a garment and not as a person. With her interactive art, the artist makes it possible for people who use her artwork to try on several different bodies and be surprised first by the visual impact, and then realise that the person wearing it is still the same (Holowaty Krales, 2019).<br><br>
Umberto Boccioni’s famous futurist sculpture ‘Unique Forms of Continuity with Space’ (Boccioni, 1913-1931) in Figure 11 depicts a hybrid of human forms and mechanical ones. How to time and space, meaning the environment and the actions, a body becomes in movement and (re)shapes the human form. The material is inorganic yet the shapes look like a mixture of organic bodily movements. 
The last artwork I will mention is the ballet <a href="https://youtu.be/o9RkpKbkrlo">‘body_remix/goldberg_variations’</a> by choreographer Marie Chouinard (Compagnie Marie Chouinard, 2005). In Figures 12 and 13 the dancers use crutches and other technological devices that are made for disabled people. Their movements and bodily tensions are based on the interaction with this apparatus and as well, how the lack of this interaction as well, makes another discovery of how their bodies should or can move in a different way: a desired relationship with the non-human.<br><br>

	<b>Abstract:</b><br><br>
This final master's project focuses on analysing and trying to understand what kind of body configurations result from a xenotransplanted human and thus detect what types of concepts around the body are generated from these beings beyond the human. To do this, various onto-epistemological, ethical and scientific-technological questions related to cross-species organ xenotransplantation and the creation of pig-human genetic chimeras are addressed, based on a bibliographic review and interviews with three experts on the subject from different perspectives. areas of study: 1) the vice president of the French Transhumanist Association: Technoprog; 2) a post-queer and metahumanist philosopher, transdisciplinary and digital artist, activist and ontohacker; and 3) a pioneer xenotransplantation researcher and heart transplant surgeon.<br><br>

This research presents a posthumanist approach that intertwines the new materialisms and the deleuze-guattari theory of assemblage (assemblage theory) to reveal the various positions on a subject whose ethical implications intersect with multiple philosophical, scientific and social perspectives. This research unfolds a series of rhizomatic methods and post-qualitative principles that help to deal with the data framework that is built from interviews with specialists, the literature that frames this work and my reflective gaze as a researcher, trying to capture the uniqueness and the agency of each of the actors in this network, as well as their potentiality and intra-action as a whole. For this, I created a web site that accounts for the entire process and where the intra-actions, displacements, connections and different paths and drifts experienced throughout the investigation are reflected. The reader will be able to review this website as he reads the text and re-visit it as many times as necessary, as a result of the hyperlinks that are placed throughout the text.<br><br>

<b>Resumen:</b>
Este trabajo final de máster se centra en analizar y tratar de comprender qué tipo de configuraciones corporales resultan de un humano xenotrasplantado y así detectar qué tipos de conceptos en torno al cuerpo se generan a partir de estos seres más allá de lo humano. Para ello, se abordan diversas cuestiones onto-epistemológicas, éticas y científico-tecnológicas relacionadas con el xenotrasplante de órganos entre especies y la creación de quimeras genéticas cerdo-humano, a partir de la revisión bibliográficas y entrevistas a tres expertos en el tema desde diferentes áreas de estudio: 1) el vicepresidente de la Asociación Transhumanista Francesa: Technoprog; 2) un filósofo post-queer y metahumanista, artista transdisciplinar y digital, activista y ontohacker; y 3) un investigador pionero en xenotrasplantes y cirujano de trasplantes de corazón.<br><br>

Esta investigación presenta un enfoque posthumanista que entrelaza los nuevos materialismos y la teoría deleuze-guattari del ensamblaje (assemblage theory) para revelar las diversas posiciones frente a un tema cuyas implicaciones éticas se entrecruzan con múltiples miradas filosóficas, científicas y sociales. Esta investigación despliega una serie de métodos rizomáticos y principios post-cualitativos que ayudan a hacer frente al entramado de datos que se construye a partir de las entrevistas a especialistas, la literatura que enmarca este trabajo y mi mirada reflexiva como investigadora, intentando captar la singularidad y el agenciamiento de cada uno de los actores de esta red, así como su potencialidad e intra-acción en su conjunto. Para esto, elaboré una página web que da cuenta de todo el proceso y donde se plasman las intra-acciones, desplazamientos, conexiones y diferentes caminos y derivas vividas a lo largo de la investigación. El lector podrá revisar esta web a medida que va leyendo el texto, revisitando tantas veces como sea necesario, a raíz de los hipervínculos que se van colocando a lo largo del texto.<br><br>

<b>Palabras clave:</b> Xenotransplantación, quimerismo genético, cuerpos, posthumanismo, nuevos materialismos, teoría del ensamblaje.

The increasing scarcity of available organs is the biggest problem in transplantology; therefore, it is necessary to find new and alternative sources for organ transplantation. A promising breakthrough solution is xenotransplantation using genetic engineering technologies to create a high-throughput engineering of human compatibility, that is, the use of animal cells, tissues and organs inserted into the human body. The domesticated pig raised in a laboratory is the optimal donor for this type of transplant, since its DNA is similar to that of the human being and the size of its organs is also similar. However, xenogeneic transplantation from pigs to humans involved high immunological incompatibility and a complex rejection process. The rapid development of genetic engineering techniques allows genome modifications in pigs that reduce the immune barrier between species.<br><br>

Starting from the hypothesis that the definition of the human body can no longer be applied as such in the case of chimera xenotransplanted human beings, this paper focuses on paying attention to the concepts and categories of body that may arise from this, taking into account the human-animal-machine relationship. As well as analyse the implications that this entails both in the study of the body and ethically from the perspective of new materialism, posthumanism, assemblage theory and what Karen Barad calls “agential realism" (Barad, 2007). Additionally this thesis will be complemented with a website in which the reader can find all the content and have access to it in an interactive way. I will explain this further in the methodology section. <br><br>

Thus, this thesis is oriented towards how genetic chimaerism can generate a definition of "human body" and "human nature" that is divergent and more open than the conception rooted in the humanist and positivist tradition. In this bodily problem, it must be conceived, both from the ontological, epistemological, and ethical aspect, to avoid the single understanding of its biological and psychosocial status and being open to its relational dimension, as a human and non-human bond (animals for xenotransplantation).<br><br> 

From this point, the primary research question, and some secondary questions that I wanted to explore the answers for were generated. I understood that a research question is not an arrival point, but a starting point, which opens the door to unexpected events that emerge during the research process.<br><br> 

<div class="subtitles">Research Questions:</div><br><br>

<div class="subsubtitles">Primary research question:</div><br><br>
What kind of body conceptions or configurations are generated based on xenotransplanted humans?<br><br> 

<div class="subsubtitles">Secondary questions:</div><br><br>
<div class="indent">-What happens to the category of the human body and what ethical scope does the human-animal-technology relationship entail?<br><br>
- What significance does the relationship between human and non-human animals have in biotechnological advances? And how has it evolved/changed in recent years?<br><br>
- If body parts represent who someone “is” then how do changes, additions and subtractions alter the sense of the self from a biological and psychosocial perspective?</div><br><br>

To explore these questions and see where the research is taking out, I set out  certain objectives to outline the trajectory of this work.<br><br>

<div class="subsubtitles">Main objective:</div> To reveal the diversity of body conceptions and configurations, emerged from xenotransplanted humans’ discussion.<br><br>

<div class="sub-subtitles">Specific objectives:</div><br><br>
To conduct an exhaustive theoretical and bibliographical literature review.
To perform a set of interviews with specialists in the field of my research topic.
To generate knowledge based on the combination of the outcomes of the interviews and the theoretical and bibliographical literature.
To think rhizomatically about the concepts and conclusions. 
To create a website where the intra-actions, displacements, connections and different paths and drifts throughout the research are captured, with the purpose of visually representing the body of work of the thesis with a new materialist and posthuman approach.

My interest in the human body and its modifications or physical transformations has been generated from my personal experience with my own body while practising ballet for almost twenty years. I began to dance when I was four years old and I spent my childhood watching ballet plays instead of cartoons, making performances in my living room and since then I just can’t shake off the perception of my own bodily presence. My dream was to be a swan, the animal that in the famous Tchaikovsky ballet takes a human-like form by day and becomes a swan at night. I remember being in front of the mirror and trying to replicate the movement of the wings of a swan.<br><br>
My half-brother is a painter. In his early years as an artist, he met his girlfriend,a sculpture artist. Her art at that point was
related to mortality and materiality as when she was younger, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which she healed properly from, yet it defined a noticeable relationship with the terms of her own death. This fear or bodily finitude was translated into her artworks. As my brother’s and his girlfriend's art was my first approximation to the field of the Fine Arts and this has had a great impact on me as I can now observe from my own work and research interests.<br><br> 
My brother’s girlfriend would take life casting moulds of me as a child and then transform them into body horror sculptures. I remember very clearly that once I went to the art gallery where she was exhibiting her work and a copy of my bent legs was transformed into a hyper realistic birth of a mutilated baby. As well, once I helped him with a performance in which I had to wear a mask similar to the painting Ovo Nero from Figure 1 (Grün, 2003). It had four mutilated and joined faces which were the participants of the collective my brother was part of and whose name was the same as the painting. I remember that when I saw my reflection in the mirror, I confronted myself with the lack of my own face, that now was one with four faces, or fundamentally, another body.<br><br> 
When I was twenty-one years old, I got an undiagnosed injury which left me questioning my whole existence as an artist and performer. Transiting the unknown (not being able to dance) was tough and painful. Who would I be if I constructed my identity as a dancer swan-like-wanna-be? What if what I knew was only a little part of what life and bodily existence can mean in my life? At this moment I had to let go of my previous conceptions and mutate into what I am now actually, now writing this thesis.<br><br>  
In 2019 I decided to confront my own body, my autonomy, and the control I exert over it by trying to heal my injury, which years later would still bother me. I began to do scientific research and use myself as a guinea pig, or in other words, I would try to dictate my life from a biohacking perspective. Quantifying my bodily inputs and outputs, I became my own research project and was eager to know more about the self, the body, and the intimate construction of it until I found the source of it all: the DNA. Since we live in a world with great advances in genetic engineering technologies that allow physical transformations, my interest in the thesis research topic is an entanglement of life and performative experiences.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Theoretical framework: Weaving post-humanism and new materialism perspectives with xenotransplantation, genetic chimaerism and interspecies.</div><br><br>
The body understood as the inhuman, beyond the human and more than human, is directly related to the outside, to the world and to everything that surrounds it, breaking in this way with the exterior-interior dualistic division when thinking about it human-animal as oppositions (Rogoswka-Strangret, 2017). The concepts will be analysed from the ‘ethico-onto-epistem-ology’, posthumanism, new materialism and assemblage theories perspectives. I will aim to create, analyse, and define new conceptions based on interdisciplinary thinking in the process of Deleuzian becoming (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987). Breaking the biological barrier from observations of cartesian post-dualism that separates mind and body since I observe genetic chimaerism as a single being that entangles a double genomic identity. What Barad calls “matter and meaning are not separate elements” (Barad, 2007, p. 3) as of what it means to breed life and bodies in a lab. I will proceed to describe the theories and the bibliographical bases from where my research questions begin to get answers and generate new concepts.<br><br>
Posthumanism:<br><br> 
<div id="text-margin">[...] is often defined as a posthumanism and a post-anthropocentrism: it is "post" to the concept of the human and to the historical occurrence of humanism, both based, as we have previously seen, on hierarchical social constructs and human centric assumptions. Speciesism has turned into an integral aspect of the posthuman critical approach. The posthuman overcoming of human primacy, though, is not to be replaced with other types of primacies (such as the one of the machines). Posthumanism can be seen as a post-exclusivism: an empirical philosophy of mediation which offers a reconciliation of existence in its broadest significations. (Ferrando, 2013, p. 4)</div><br>
The word agency is understood as the ability to modify, intervene, displace, or serve to create something or a situation (Coole & Frost, 2010). Things always appear in relation to other things. Independent movement of any of these apparently separate bodies results in a change to generate other movements and tensions or stresses. Anthropocentricity is left behind as there is a hybrid between the human and the non-human. The non-human has to do with what surrounds us in our existence, in this particular study, the relationship with the genetically modified pigs. The distributive agency understands power as something much more complex and infinitely intertwined. Power is actually between all material bodies, both human and non-human or more than human, and therefore does not belong to the bodies independently, but occurs because material and human bodies always depend on each other. From the new materialist theory:<br><br>
<div id="text-margin">Agency is a core term used in new materialist theory, but different theorists put the notion to work in a myriad of ways. Rosi Braidotti refers to agency as synonymous with 'political subjectivity' in terms of her call for the creation of new forms of ethical agency (Braidotti, 2012, p. 31-5). Karen Barad stresses the non-human aspect of agency; insisting that agency is understood as 'an enactment.' Barad's theory is one that describes the physics of the observation of a world where: "Agential intra-actions are causal enactments." (2007, p. 176) For Barad, 'agency' is not an attribute of something or someone; rather it is the process of cause and effect in "enactment" (p. 214): "Agency is 'doing' or 'being' in its intra-activity. It is the enactment of iterative changes to particular practices – interactive reconfigurings of topological manifolds of space-time-matter relations ­– through the dynamics of intra-activity." (p. 178). Like Braidotti, Barad's position also argues that in and through the entanglements of matter, agency also refers to the "possibilities for worldly re-configurings". (Barad, 2012, p. 55, quoted in Colman, 2018, n.d.)</div><br>
New materialisms and posthuman thinking allow me to create new possibilities of my narration writing and to critically think from a broader sense the materialisation of it.  They propose a non-dualist and co-constitutive approach to understanding the intra-actions and agency of all concepts, terms, materials, organic and mechanical materiality that opens new paths of enquiry questions in and throughout the research process.<br><br>

			<div class="subtitles">Agency and Assemblage theory</div><br><br>

The human does not necessarily have to be the centre of enquiry, but we can understand how the human connects with the non-human (Hood & Kraehe, 2017). This has to do with the theory of agency which focuses on what we can observe and what we can investigate and does not necessarily have to do with people or with the human, but rather with an interaction and intra-action (Barad, 2007). The assemblage theory is what causes assemblages. It can help us understand the idea of the body as a puzzle in which editing, inserting, and hiding DNA meets the concept of interspecies. The assemblages are what we go through and what helps us understand the relationships between complementary elements and what the axes of power are, as well as hierarchies and inequalities. How elements, or in this case, two different DNAs are connected with each other and co-habitate / live in the same body.<br><br>
Assemblies cause movement and give the ability to modify a situation, they can be dynamically configured and reconfigured (De Landa, 2006). This always has to do with the territory, limits, frontiers, borders, ways of doing things based on the configuration of this territory. The arrangement of material objects and the relationship between them, something that invites you or provokes something determined, how objects affect a future that opens the possibility of creating or not an action to create various movements, possibilities and tensions based on the various assemblies.<br><br>
Then I can say that the context is an intra-action with agency power in the future (Barad, 2003). In the assemblage, what matters is not only the final process of the things that come together to generate an assemblage, but also the process in which things occur (De Landa, 2016; Acuto & Curtis, 2013). The becoming that allows an agency to take place. Agency is also a product that consists of composing various pieces together and that conjunction allows us to do something. It is not only the product but also the process which takes shape, or one could say that it is the process in which that product is established and generated. Agency can always change; it never has a finished character, and it has different multiple dynamic intensities and are in constant motion (Deleuze & Parnet, 1980; Fox & Aldred, 2015).<br><br> 
Introducing ‘Long live the New Flesh’ as a hypothesis, a bio-constructed body, is an attempt to resolve the thanatophobia and anxiety through an embodied performance (Haddow, 2021). With the use of xenotransplantation, the research will explore forms, conceptions, and concepts to determine the knowledge of this type of body / human without precedent.<br><br>

</figure>

What results from xenotransplantation is genetic chimaerism. A chimera is an organism who has two populations of genetically distinct cells or two populations of cells with two different genetic heritages, meaning: two DNAs (Norton & Zehner, 2008). Talking about the subject of mythology, a chimera is a fire-breathing creature who was the descendant of Typhon and Echidna (both themselves half-serpent, half-human creatures). Animals and mythological topics were particularly popular subjects in Etruscan art and particularly in the bronze work ‘Chimera of Arezzo’ of Cosimo de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (Gáldy, 2003) as you can see in figure 15. The definition of chimera is:<br><br>

This monstrous beast was first mentioned in the Iliad, where Homer describes it as a hybrid of three different creatures: a lion, a goat and a snake. The beast’s head was fire-breathing; the Chimera was killed by the noble Bellerophon, son of Glaucus, as the Gods predicted. The Chimera is also mentioned in Hesiod’s Theogony and in Virgil’s Aeneid. Servius Honoratus refers that the creature was originally from Lycia, where there was a namesake volcano with lions on top, pastures for goats at mid height, and snakes slithering at the bottom. This is where the myth is said to be born. Plutarch suggested instead that Chimera was the name of a pirate who adorned the sails of his ship with the images of a lion, a goat and a Montpellier snake. (Muse Firenze, n.d.)<br><br>

From a genetic perspective there are diverse ways to make a chimera. One is by performing xenotransplantation or using xenografts, which is a proposition that till now carries within it a lot of risks because the host’s immune system may cause the organ to be rejected. Another method is to begin at the embryonic level, introducing one animal’s cells into the embryo of another and letting them grow together into a hybrid body (Moran et. al, 2021). One more technique is by mixing human blood serum with pig cells which I will further explain at the conclusion of the interview with Benjamin Smith. The researchers on genetics and hybridisation Lachezar Nikolov and Miltos Tsiantis describe that:<br><br> 

<div id="text-margin">One way to study the genetic basis for trait diversity is to apply a transgenic approach and introduce genes of interest from a donor into a recipient species. Such interspecies gene transfer (IGT) is based on the premise that if a gene is causal to the morphological divergence of the two species, the transfer will endow the recipient with properties of the donor. Recent technical advances in the field of xenotransplantation and chimera research now allow the manufacture of human organs in animals and consequently the creation of human–animal chimeras. Due to the serious organ scarcity, the medical demands are clear, notably for organ transplantation. Nonetheless, such a viewpoint creates significant legal and ethical concerns. (Nikolov & Miltos, 2015, p. 1)</div><br><br>

The implications of designing chimeras with human genetic material raises questions of how much of a  “human” the rendered creature is. Philip Karpowicz and his research colleagues argued that<br>
<div id="text-margin"> If such a chimera exhibited signs of emergent human mental capacities, conducting biomedical experiments upon it might be essentially equivalent to conducting the same experiments on a human person. Human dignity would be undermined by the transfer of emergent and super cellular psychological human functions into research subjects that consequently possess the same capacities themselves. (Karpowicz et al., 2004, pp. 333-334).</div><br><br>

Dignity arguments fail for a similar reason: it is difficult to articulate a consistent ethical principle that explains why, and in what way, the creation of human-animal interspecies is a violation of human dignity, while other types of human-animal mixing are supposedly unproblematic (Huther, 2009). The ethical issues raised by xenotransplantation include the limitation of genetic diseases transmissible from animals to humans, the crossing of the inter-species barrier, and social acceptance of the practise. Furthermore, xenotransplantation intends to make significant changes in legal aspects, particularly in terms of regulations governing research and access to organ donation (Lesage, 2022).

The first transgenic pig was designed and produced in the middle of the eighties  injecting copies of human growth hormone genes into fertilised eggs (Koo et. al, 2012). Pig farms have grown to be enormous and commercial pig production businesses in order to attain these high numbers. Each year, more than one billion pigs are slaughtered throughout the world. At the beginning of the applied research on transgenic pigs was for agricultural purposes but now pigs are mostly utilized for human consumption, but they also provide skin, fat, and other materials for apparel, processed food components, cosmetics, and other medicinal purposes, moreover as well for xenotransplantation (de la Casa, 2017).  Pigs went from being companion species to becoming cyborgs or technology in itself (Haraway, 2003). These animals that grow in laboratories, in pathogens free both the cyborg animals and dogs in particular and cybernetic machines in particular genetic engineering technologies (Fishman et. al, 2012) and companion species or pigs that are designed in the era where genomes can be acquired, designed, manufactured.<br><br>
To optimise the benefits of xenotransplantation, the most recent advances in several sectors of research, such as animal science, biotechnology, genomics, and so on, must be used. These elements interact and complement one another, resulting in valuable breeding. The possible spread of pathogenic microorganisms from the organ host pig to the recipient is the most essential issue when using pigs for xenotransplantation (Johnson, 2022). To eliminate this danger, pigs should be kept free of certain bacteria, fungus, protozoa, and viruses that might cause diseases for humans.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Theorising data, rather than theory</div><br><br>
	Theorizing is the moulding, shaping and/or forming of a theory or theories about a specific topic. Theorizing rather than theory and transforming the data from the interviews and theoretical papers into a new space of reflexivity that allows exchange, pushes relationality that is necessary to generate science and knowledge (Mckinley, 2020). Theorizing produces a new material and articulated body of knowledge so that the researcher remains in the state of in-betweenness. Theorizing not from a static state or approach, but instead letting the fluctuations and their variations of movements during the research period and its entangled tensions lead its own process and rhizomatic diverse outcomes and conclusions.

Xenotransplantation is such a controversial topic and it’s very important to denote that meanwhile doing research i understood that the subjective opinions (or voices) should all be included and heard because we are talking about sensitive topics related to animal and human rights, and he meaning, the creation and the extension of human and non-human lifeforms. Theorizing from different and sometimes quite opposite points of view let me understand my research topic on a global scale.<br><br>


I didn’t conduct the research process by seeking a fixed conclusion but instead I looked for reflections. What I realized during the research process is that more I investigated about the topic, more questions were generated based on the research itself:<br><br>

Is human life more relevant than any other life forms? Why yes or no?<br>
How much will we be able to replace body parts to extend lives and / or borrow biological time from xenotransplantation?<br>
If other species kill each other for food and protection, what does xenotransplantation and taking the survival of the fittest theory (reference) into human hands mean for the future of biodiversity and transpecies relations?<br>
If we get to a point that the rejection of xenotransplantation organs is totally reduced, does this mean that we could become closer to animals genetically speaking or are we vanishing the meaning of the human species?<br>
What are the variables or the intra-actions that bound the biological and psychosocial aspects of the construction and configurations of a body?<br>
How much can we reject our own biological predestination and body?<br>
How much does it affect what we think about ourselves more than what we “actually” are?<br>
How can this dissertation might later on become a PhD research topic to keep on inquiring about?<br>

    <h2>Didier Cournelle</h2>
    <p>Didier Cournelle: The average lifespan is rising for people all around the world but the maximal lifespan is not rising. Big Data in healthcare is a tool that binds all the information from quantified bodies and what can bind bodies information and the relation to one another. A web of thousands and millions of input data from humans all around the world. The issue with Big Data is the shared knowledge if private companies decide to not make public or share their research health data that could and or should be a common public good. There’s no public organization in the world that has officially the goal to fight against diseases of old age or that make people live longer and big companies like Google are working in the field of genetics and rejuvenation but there’s still no big progress. Altos Labs is something very new, they work specially in the rejuvenation of cells and they are starting with big names in the genetic field there is hope that it would be useful. <br><br>

Gene therapy, cell rejuvenation or other body modification practices will have to do with having a longer life but still it will not be enough to trick it. Your body is changing all the time and from his point of view, the fact that xenotransplantation is put to practice on humans does not change the definition of the concept of ‘human being’ and does not make it something else. Our body can be seen as an interchangeable object in which you can add or subtract parts of or to it but would still remain the same as in the ‘Ship of Theseus’ paradox. The quest of life is in itself to have a longer and healthier life using all technological progress to realize this. <br><br>

Why is it good  to live longer and healthier? Living longer and health care is positive in many aspects because we have more time to love each other and to discover things. We have more time for empathy and so on but it's also good for society in general because  when people live longer, they are more careful with each other. They are more careful with the environment and maybe even more important because they are less violent. Technological progress can be a very positive, but also very dangerous thing relating to the history of humanity, but today is also the most dangerous day of the history of humanity. From the interviewee’s point of view xenotransplantation is very promising but it is not yet to be used against ageing because of course ageing is a multiple aspect phenomenon and therefore we die of diseases related to old age. It might provide a better quality of life but not longevity per se.</p>

  <div class="column">
    <h2>Jaime del Val</h2>
    <p>From a metahumanist point of view we should raise questions about the abuse of animals that are bred for xenotransplantation as well as other forms of animal sacrifice. Since the healthcare system and the idea that we have to extend human life using any technological means is based on the conception of human supremacy over other species. Not only that but an elitist human supremacy because the human lives that need to be extended as much as possible would be mainly of the rich euro-white-anglo-american. It is related with an implicit eugenics that ignores the fact that this human suprematism is grounded on a massive planetary killing and it's associated with an heteronormative oppression that paradoxically leads us to mass extinction. It all is the same domination system, expansion of nation states, empires, imperialism, etc.<br><br> 

The governing healthcare system ignores the structural cause of most of the diseases,  that is the result of toxic lifestyles that human beings have created for themselves and that originate in bipedalism and agriculture. The result of this is the current overpopulation of the earth. This as well has to do with man's obsession with technological progress that is against the flows of the earth when playing with biodiversity and creating evolutionary paralysis in the entire planet that entails a human un-enhancement. Big Data culture has resulted in the annihilation of ‘Body Intelligence’ because it atrophies the sensory motor and movements. It makes us incapable of listening to the body, of varying our movement and senses, of relating to the world and its indeterminacy. We are making ourselves dependent on algorithmic, pharmaceutical, and other technical and technological systems that are actually at the core or our discomforts and are part of the extinction system. We are creating a ‘Planetary Holocaust’ so devastating that we are threatening our own species.<br><br> 

From this perspective the notion of genetic chimeras does not matter because we already are chimeras. It is possible to imagine a future in which transpecies families of humans and non-humans are an established fact and all animal abuse is abolished with a much lower human population. The interviewee could think of the possibility of having xenotransplantation from our transpecies kinship when they naturally or accidentally die, just as is done with human transplantation, as perhaps the only acceptable option. Then xenotransplantation could help further undo the species gap, but this is of course far from what happens today.</p>

    <h2>Benjamin Smith</h2>
    <p>The participant was involved with the first-ever heart transplantation surgeon Dr. Chris Barnard, and he was taking care of the patients after surgery after working on the preservation of hearts for transplantation. He realized back then that the shortage of organs was a big issue in the transplantation field. Firstly he did trials on baboons but later on he became interested in doing research on pigs as hosts and donors due to logistical reasons and as well from an immunological point of view they are much closer to humans. Since then he does not do any clinical work anymore but he does work testing transgenic pigs for xenotransplantation by transplanting a heart or a kidney from the pig into a monkey or a baboon. Human serum and pig cells are tested to see if the human serum kills the pig cells in the lab so the human serum will kill the pig organ if that particular genetic modification is rejected in the serum cell combination.<br><br>  

A human heart transplant would take seven days to be rejected by the recipient. Instead the genetically engineered organs from the pigs are transplanted in young baboons which will take five minutes to have an immunological response against it. The bred pigs have ten genetic modifications before the be can donors and the more they are engineered to be compatible with the recipient the less you have to expose the patient to immunosuppressant drugs therapy. In the lab you can structure antigens on a pig cell so the patients no longer have antibodies against the pig because the animal it’s designed to suit that particular patient. There are all sorts of potential ways that eventually will make pig organs a much better source of organs than human ones for the majority of patients.<br><br>  

Babies have a weaker immunological response and their immune system is much more flexible and plastic. They have a lower response to both pig cells and to human cells than adults do and those patients do better than any other patients with any type of organ transplant. A heart xenotransplantation done on babies could allow them to extend their lives while they wait for another baby human donor to die. There are a lot of adult patients who will be dead or be taken off the waiting list within five years because they are no longer suitable. Xenotransplantation could be a great solution for kidney diseased patients that are in dialysis treatment because their organs deteriorate at such a rapid pace that putting a pig's kidney meanwhile they wait for a human resource could keep them alive.<br><br>  

Pigs for xenotransplantation are bred in very clean facilities so that they won't carry any infections with them. The staff who look after them put on a sort of space suit every day so they don't give the pig any infections for themselves. The pigs are tested every month to make sure they've not got any infectious organisms that you could transfer with the graft whereas most with human donors you have literally a few hours to check. The transgenic pigs will be housed under very clean, ideal conditions, given the perfect diet and instead of being slaughtered by having their throats cut like in other food facilities they will be anaesthetized and they will die under the anaesthesia when taking the organs out. So from a pig's point of view it's a much more humane life and death than the average pig.<br><br> 

The psychological and sociological aspects of a genetic chimerism based on pig to human xenotransplantation is what is more relevant than the concept of a genetic chimera in itself and it’s similar to when a human to human organ transplantation is performed. In adults the reactions of xenotransplantation could be managed with a conscious and mature approach with psychotherapy. In children the topic should be supervised in a private and discreet manner so they won't be exposed to the possibility of bullying or other psychological problems. They don’t need to know about the details until they are older enough to understand and accept what was performed on their bodies to preserve their lives. Most people would accept xenotransplantation if it's going to be life-saving for them. Patients would accept the doubts they have in their mind if they know it's the only way they can stay alive even though they may still have some deep-seated concerns that they're not entirely human.</p>

</div>

<div style="font-size: 1rem"><br><br>After considering what was manifested in the interviews, my own reflections about the topic are the following: Man is the only animal that is aware of the certainty that he is going to die, so there are great concerns that have to do with extending life and fighting against diseases seeking a subjective good life quality. The longevity of life, although it has extended to part of the population of the planet, has not increased significantly or radically. “Long live the New Flesh” is a concept that has not to do with longevity itself, but with the idea of a human borrowing extra years from becoming a genetic chimera by using xenotransplantation. The United States Food and Drug Administration allows xenotransplantation research conducted in research facilities only if the mutations can’t be transmitted to reproductive cells, therefore the offspring of the chimeras will not have a genetic alteration (Benjamin, personal communication, 6th June 2022). Even though techno progressivism has altruistic ideals to put into practice, those to make technologies available for everyone is somehow questionable.<br><br> 

We have to see the long term effects of the results of pig to human xenotransplantation and I believe that it won’t be possible without testing the organs in even more humans and not in baboons. This also makes me question how much we can quantify our bodies, till where can we add, subtract and any parts of the body. Also I can reflect on the concept of ‘divide and conquer’ as the human obsession with controlling himself and everything that surrounds him can now be taken with the help of genetic engineering technologies to define DNA, the source of all living lifeforms. This possibility of replacing our body with a new body can give rise to the idea of avoiding death, that is, that the human being could somehow 'be eternal'.<br><br>

Trying to define what body type or configuration is generated in xenotransplantation brought to my attention even more questions than answers. How much can humans extend themselves by putting their DNA into other living forms, in this case pigs that become hosts of our DNA to generate organs for xenotransplantation? Does this make us become closer to animals or grow more apart from other humans? The genetic chimeras that result from xenotransplantation risk having more struggles to know who they might be themselves, which is their identity and this is a very personal and subjective journey. Even though we humans try to control our life path, we can do it within a limited time and space frame. The possibility that more people in the world can have a healthier and longer life can allow us to have an optimistic vision about the care that human beings will and could give to the planet, to themselves and to other species. <br><br>

From this thoughts I propose a new concept of body that is generated upon the creation of a xenotransplanted human:<br><br>

Xeno-in-bodied: The meaning of bodied is “having a body of a specified kind — used in combination” (reference). From this premise I argue that the body is seen as a quantifiable matter and can be self-organized or organised by agency forces from humans even at a genetic level. We are striving for designed bodies where DNA is put in another host and the human is genetically living in another body. A body that is gestated in a lab and it grows inside an animal, a non-human body. This reflects on a question: are we our DNA? To explain the term ‘Xeno-in-bodied’ I used the term ‘xeno’ because the organs develop outside the human, ‘in’ because it comes back to the human body, and ‘bodied’ because it’s a quantifiable organised and controlled matter, a voluntary body modification of the individual. The transferred encoded data becomes a new flesh in which structures are interchangeable from outside sources. The body can be understood as a systematic organism with modular structures with mechanical assistance. The xenotransplanted human is a new material that is an assemblage directed and the. The reconfiguration of the human body that is created upon using the pig as a technological tool that is inserted into the human by xenotransplantation, changes the definition of pigs and the notion of their animal nature as well. A limitless and boundless encoded body emerges among the expansion of DNA xeno-living where sub-organisms create a whole-organism system. This creates a report to ecological and evolutionary success, in which human supremacy is a core concept of the created body and animal sacrifice is due to speciesism hierarchy. If we get to a point where immunological response from xenotransplants is nonexistent, the biological barrier that exists in between transgenic pigs and humans will disappear.<br><br> 

Ambivalent body configuration from a social standpoint: Socially speaking, pigs can be seen as repulsive or dirty animals. There are two important issues related to both the societal and individual response to xenotransplantation and the xenotransplanted person. The individual may be aware that this is the only resource that will allow him to survive, in which case his positive reaction will contribute to the success of the surgical intervention. This can vary according to the life experience, ideas and emotions of each individual. On the other hand, the collective social reaction towards a xenotransplanted being will vary rhizomatically. For example: a person whose criterion is to equate animals with human beings will reject any intervention of this type, considering it cruel towards the former. The opposite will happen if human life is considered the most relevant in the chain of species. In any case, the xenotransplanted human will be seen as an ambivalent and new being. In addition, one of the possible results is mockery, bullying or bewilderment towards the unknown.<br><br>

The age of genetic-chimeras: The creation of human-pig chimeras highlights speciesism as an ethical ideal and the concept of human and animal dignity. Scientific possibilities allow the combination of human and non-human species and that does not rely on categorization into human and nonhuman categories. As xenotransplantation procedures progress the definitions of human will mutate and vary depending on the immunological response. The xenotransplanted person will be considered in the scientific field as a human being, and will not be treated as an animalistic creature. The idea of the mythological chimeric creature will lose its power as xenotransplantation becomes a not so extraordinary process. This changed the human-animal relationship to the core, where the pigs now are not companion species anymore but they are a tool for human life extension.<br><br>   

Long live the new flesh: Another concept that emerges is a post-cyborg body. Petkovsek & Zalec say that “cyborgization is the connection of mechanic and organic, as two autonomous systems benefiting the host system. Contemporary technology can combine the artificial mechanic parts and the artificial biological parts in some medical operations such as a sex limb change, prosthetic ears or skin implantation made by using 3D bioprinting. In this way cyborgization spread from combining artificial machine systems to connecting the body with artificial systems, where both the biological and mechanical can be artificially produced by technology. Still, this does not include transplantation or any chemical influence to the psychological or emotional state of a human” (Petkovsek & Zalec, 2021).<br><br>

What can be argued about the premises of the previously mentioned authors is that transplantation does not take part in the cyborgization process, but xenotransplantation does. Due to the fact that the pigs that are being bred for hosting human organs are technology in itself, the xenotransplanted human would become a post-cyborg even though the organ is a biological material. A xenotransplanted human would not be separate from the designed organ which is technology in itself but he would be actually a part of it. This body is thoughtfully controlled and escapes randomness and nature’s adversity. Genetically engineering technologies create a different quest for immortalisation where death due to degenerative organs is not inevitable.
