<div class="two-columns" style="margin-top: 2%"><div class="subtitles" style="text-align:left;">Background of the research problem and state of the art</div><br>Attempts to treat people using animal material, such as tissues or organs, are not new. In 1628, Colle de Belluno of Padua performed the first human blood transfusions, and in 1682, a doctor attempted to transplant a part of a dog’s skull onto a Russian man who had been injured. The earliest verified attempts at xenotransplantation were made as early as the 18th century, and the first dog or cat corneal transplants were unsuccessfully attempted to heal patients who eventually went blind (Ullman, 1902). The U.S. Food and Drug Administration defines xenotransplantation as “any procedure that involves the transplantation, implantation, or infusion into a human recipient of either (a) live cells, tissues, or organs from a nonhuman animal source, or (b) human body fluids, cells, tissues, or organs that have had ex vivo contact with live nonhuman animal cells, tissues, or organs” (U.S. FDA, 2021).<br><br>
Grafts of animal skin tissue were accomplished around the end of the nineteenth century. It was particularly around the early 1900s when the trials multiplied. Mathieu Jaboulay, in 1906, accomplished the first two animal organ transplants on humans. The first patient was a woman who had kidney failure by transplanting. A pig kidney was placed outside the human body, at the bend of the elbow, but the graft did not work. He repeated the experiment a few months later using a goat kidney, which was also a failure. It was then the turn of monkeys reputed to be close to humans to serve as raw material for Serge Voronoff for tissue grafts from their testicles on men in order to restore their vitality. It was then necessary to wait until the beginning of the 1960s for new xenografts to be attempted. (Hamilton, 2012) In 1954, the first human organs successful transplant was from the identical twin brother kidney’s deceased patient Richard Herrick. Previously this would be considered a deadly illness, but with the help of the new transplant the first recipient could live eight more years (Powell, 2011).<br><br> 
From Friday January 7, 2022, a 57-year-old man lived with a genetically modified pig’s heart for two months (Rabin, 2022). The xenotranspla3ntation on this patient was announced Monday, January 10 by a team from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in the United States of America. (University of Maryland School, 2022). David Bennett, a sufferer of an end-stage heart failure and arrhythmia, was ineligible for a conventional heart transplant, or even an artificial heart pump system. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) therefore authorised this experimental strategy on a compassionate basis, in this consenting patient and without any other therapeutic option. He became the first human being whose life could have been saved thanks to a xenotransplantation.<br><br>
Nicholas L. Tilney in his book ‘Transplant: From Myth to Reality’ wrote: “When I got here in 1964, the early mortality rate following transplantation was as high as 50 percent. By the end of the year, there were virtually no survivors. Now, if someone dies, it’s a cause of great angst” (Tilney, 2003, p. 86). What kind of questions can the author ask now that with the help of genome editing technologies is it possible to design a molecular fairy-tale in the field of genetic engineering to end the battle of immunological response in organ transplantation and create a personalised bio-formulated and controlled one in a lab?<br><br>
In practise, the pig currently appears to be the most appropriate animal species as a source of cultivation of organs for humans. The porcine species has many advantages in this respect because: Uncontroversial use for the human species; easy breeding; possible to breed germ-free or organ-free animals; suitable size and similar physiology of transplantable organs compared to humans (Klymiuk et al., 2010). The advantages of xenografts appear as a good fit for breeded organs. Xenografts would make it possible to definitively solve the problem of the shortage of organs; they would also bring a radical answer to all the ethical questions relating to the removal of human organs, whether removal from a living donor or from a corpse.<br><br>
Another factor further aggravates the situation. Although very favourable in the short term, the percentage of success of organ transplants gradually decreases over time by the destruction of an increasing proportion of graft; there is an unlimited availability of xenografts; organ transplantation becomes an elective intervention (a controllable / malleable bodily feature); guarantee of organs quality and the use of donors germ-free of specific pathogens.<br><br>
Although it will be important to review, map and understand the technological processes and the scientific processes that xenotransplantation entails, the study problem focuses on the body theme and the ethic-onto-epistemological implications that bio-constructed xenotransplanted bodies can have beyond the human. Hence, my references will not include just science theoretical scholars, but also philosophers, artists and researchers who have analysed these topics from different fields of study.<br><br> 
To relate science socio historical event to artistic practise I will now mention artists from diverse fields that work on topics and create artworks related to body modification, morphological freedom, mutations, and human body (re)design:<br><br> 
Agi Haines’ work is focused on human body speculative design and “the weird and wonderful things that exist inside us” (Haines, n.d). She questions the social response to new bodies that can be seen as malleable material and looks at the human body as a system of interchangeable parts. As you can see in the Figure 2, her artwork ‘​​Circumventive Organs’ (Haines, 2013) refers to a speculative future anatomical lesson or a natural sciences museum. It questions how bioprinting can make it possible for new organs to become a part of our reality:<br><br>
[T]he ability to replicate and print cells in complex structures could mean different cells with various functions could be put together in new ways to create new organs we would take millions of years to evolve naturally. Frankenstein-esque hybrid organs could then be put together using cells from different body parts or even different species. (Haines, n.d.)<br><br>  
Patricia Piccinini’s sculptures make us reimagine our relationship with nature and animals through her art. The display of her artwork ‘The Young Family’ in Figure 3 (Piccinini, 2002) resembles animals that were bred in a laboratory. A chimera who’s new materialisation comes from the combination of creative thinking, speculative design and scientific research. She thinks the body, human and / or animal as an artistic interface and she sculpts “life forms that don’t exist” (Badham, 2017) and envisions a hyper-realistic view of hypothetical hybrid bodies.<br><br>
The Australian performance artist, Stelarc, makes art out of the human body. His project, a combination of divergence of using his body as an artistic tool and interface combining robotics and cybernetics. ‘The Ear of Arm’ (Stelarc, 2008) in Figures 4 and 5 is an example of how a hybrid body can be constructed where he implanted a “third ear” in his forearm that grew in a mouse (Stelarc, n.d.).<br><br> 
This also questions how the body can be cropped into pieces, adding, and subtracting organs, cells, tissues - a body with an interchangeable character. The artist describes the body as a thing that from the biological point is not properly organised and that “[t] he body needs to be Internet enabled in more intimate ways. THE EAR ON ARM project suggests an alternate anatomical architecture - the engineering of a new organ for the body: an available, accessible, and mobile organ for other bodies in other places, enabling people to locate and listen in to another body elsewhere (Stelarc, n.d.).<br><br>
The provocative artist Wim Delvoye began to tattoo live pigs in the 1990s. He began to experiment with tattooing the skin of dead pigs. Seven years later, he transitioned to work with a new material: the skin or pigs that were alive as a canvas for his artworks. He raised the pigs in a farm in the outskirts of Beijing, China and created the concept of art farm, a place where he would develop his artistic practise with the help of veterinarians to put pigs to sleep to be tattooed. As well to take care of the scars and wounds that their skin would suffer from the tattoos (Sweet, n.d).<br><br>
In an interview the artist explained, “I show the world works of art that are so alive, they have to be vaccinated…It lives, it moves, it will die. Everything is real.” (Carpentier, 2012). His work ‘Drawings and Models’ in Figures 6 and 7 questions the value of material, as western inspired drawings made by the artists are placed into a pig’s skin and become a decorative ornament who has no other purpose than to shock. In this respect, these pieces are not just limited to the never-ending question of what art is, but also worth reflecting on the ethical implications of some artistic practises. Is everything acceptable in the name of art?<br><br>
To explore the insides, what scares us in the unknown, the concepts of opening the body, the tangible self, the artist’s Anish Kapoor artworks ‘All inside myself’ (Kapoor, 2012) and ‘Shooting into the Corner’ (Kapoor, 2008-2009) (Kapoor, n.d) are an example of the the eagerness to discover and fantasises about a body without a human body. The material exploration that resembles a quartered body and breaks the bounds between physicality and the limits of the body form and figure.<br><br>
Sarah Sitkin in her artwork ‘Bodysuits’ (Sitkin, 2018) as in Figure 10 uses her special effects materials to create hyper-realistic figures of human torsos that function as a vest that allows you to experience another body. It also questions whether the body somehow defines our identity, making the suit function as a garment and not as a person. With her interactive art, the artist makes it possible for people who use her artwork to try on several different bodies and be surprised first by the visual impact, and then realise that the person wearing it is still the same (Holowaty Krales, 2019).<br><br>
Umberto Boccioni’s famous futurist sculpture ‘Unique Forms of Continuity with Space’ (Boccioni, 1913-1931) in Figure 11 depicts a hybrid of human forms and mechanical ones. How to time and space, meaning the environment and the actions, a body becomes in movement and (re)shapes the human form. The material is inorganic yet the shapes look like a mixture of organic bodily movements. 
The last artwork I will mention is the ballet ‘<a href="https://youtu.be/o9RkpKbkrlo">body_remix/goldberg_variations</a>’ by choreographer Marie Chouinard (Compagnie Marie Chouinard, 2005). In Figures 12 and 13 the dancers use crutches and other technological devices that are made for disabled people. Their movements and bodily tensions are based on the interaction with this apparatus and as well, how the lack of this interaction as well, makes another discovery of how their bodies should or can move in a different way: a desired relationship with the non-human.<br><br>

	<div class="subtitles"> Abstract:</div><br>
This final master's project focuses on analysing and trying to understand what kind of body configurations result from a xenotransplanted human and thus detect what types of concepts around the body are generated from these beings beyond the human. To do this, various onto-epistemological, ethical and scientific-technological questions related to cross-species organ xenotransplantation and the creation of pig-human genetic chimeras are addressed, based on a bibliographic review and interviews with three experts on the subject from different perspectives. areas of study: 1) the vice president of the French Transhumanist Association: Technoprog; 2) a post-queer and metahumanist philosopher, transdisciplinary and digital artist, activist and ontohacker; and 3) a pioneer xenotransplantation researcher and heart transplant surgeon.<br><br>

This research presents a posthumanist approach that intertwines the new materialisms and the Deleuze-Guattari theory of assemblage (assemblage theory) to reveal the various positions on a subject whose ethical implications intersect with multiple philosophical, scientific and social perspectives. This research unfolds a series of rhizomatic methods and post-qualitative principles that help to deal with the data framework that is built from interviews with specialists, the literature that frames this work and my reflective gaze as a researcher, trying to capture the uniqueness and the agency of each of the actors in this network, as well as their potentiality and intra-action as a whole. For this, I created a web site that accounts for the entire process and where the intra-actions, displacements, connections and different paths and drifts experienced throughout the investigation are reflected. The reader will be able to review this website as he reads the text and re-visit it as many times as necessary, as a result of the hyperlinks that are placed throughout the text.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Resumen:</div><br>
Este trabajo final de máster se centra en analizar y tratar de comprender qué tipo de configuraciones corporales resultan de un humano xenotrasplantado y así detectar qué tipos de conceptos en torno al cuerpo se generan a partir de estos seres más allá de lo humano. Para ello, se abordan diversas cuestiones onto-epistemológicas, éticas y científico-tecnológicas relacionadas con el xenotrasplante de órganos entre especies y la creación de quimeras genéticas cerdo-humano, a partir de la revisión bibliográficas y entrevistas a tres expertos en el tema desde diferentes áreas de estudio: 1) el vicepresidente de la Asociación Transhumanista Francesa: Technoprog; 2) un filósofo post-queer y metahumanista, artista transdisciplinar y digital, activista y ontohacker; y 3) un investigador pionero en xenotrasplantes y cirujano de trasplantes de corazón.<br><br>

Esta investigación presenta un enfoque posthumanista que entrelaza los nuevos materialismos y la teoría Deleuze-Guattari del ensamblaje (assemblage theory) para revelar las diversas posiciones frente a un tema cuyas implicaciones éticas se entrecruzan con múltiples miradas filosóficas, científicas y sociales. Esta investigación despliega una serie de métodos rizomáticos y principios post-cualitativos que ayudan a hacer frente al entramado de datos que se construye a partir de las entrevistas a especialistas, la literatura que enmarca este trabajo y mi mirada reflexiva como investigadora, intentando captar la singularidad y el agenciamiento de cada uno de los actores de esta red, así como su potencialidad e intra-acción en su conjunto. Para esto, elaboré una página web que da cuenta de todo el proceso y donde se plasman las intra-acciones, desplazamientos, conexiones y diferentes caminos y derivas vividas a lo largo de la investigación. El lector podrá revisar esta web a medida que va leyendo el texto, revisitando tantas veces como sea necesario, a raíz de los hipervínculos que se van colocando a lo largo del texto.<br><br>

The increasing scarcity of available organs is the biggest problem in transplantology; therefore, it is necessary to find new and alternative sources for organ transplantation. A promising breakthrough solution is xenotransplantation using genetic engineering technologies to create a high-throughput engineering of human compatibility, that is, the use of animal cells, tissues and organs inserted into the human body. The domesticated pig raised in a laboratory is the optimal donor for this type of transplant, since its DNA is similar to that of the human being and the size of its organs is also similar. However, xenogeneic transplantation from pigs to humans involved high immunological incompatibility and a complex rejection process. The rapid development of genetic engineering techniques allows genome modifications in pigs that reduce the immune barrier between species.<br><br>

Starting from the hypothesis that the definition of the human body can no longer be applied as such in the case of chimera xenotransplanted human beings, this paper focuses on paying attention to the concepts and categories of body that may arise from this, taking into account the human-animal-machine relationship. As well as analyse the implications that this entails both in the study of the body and ethically from the perspective of new materialism, posthumanism, assemblage theory and what Karen Barad calls “agential realism" (Barad, 2007). Additionally this thesis will be complemented with a website in which the reader can find all the content and have access to it in an interactive way. I will explain this further in the methodology section. <br><br>

Thus, this thesis is oriented towards how genetic chimaerism can generate a definition of "human body" and "human nature" that is divergent and more open than the conception rooted in the humanist and positivist tradition. In this bodily problem, it must be conceived, both from the ontological, epistemological, and ethical aspect, to avoid the single understanding of its biological and psychosocial status and being open to its relational dimension, as a human and non-human bond (animals for xenotransplantation).<br><br> 

From this point, the primary research question, and some secondary questions that I wanted to explore the answers for were generated. I understood that a research question is not an arrival point, but a starting point, which opens the door to unexpected events that emerge during the research process.<br><br><br>  

<div class="subtitles">Research Questions:</div><br><br>

<div class="subsubtitles">Primary research question:</div><br>
What kind of body conceptions or configurations are generated based on xenotransplanted humans?<br><br><br>  

<div class="subsubtitles">Secondary questions:</div><br>
<div class="indent">-What happens to the category of the human body and what ethical scope does the human-animal-technology relationship entail?<br>
- What significance does the relationship between human and non-human animals have in biotechnological advances? And how has it evolved/changed in recent years?<br>
- If body parts represent who someone “is” then how do changes, additions and subtractions alter the sense of the self from a biological and psychosocial perspective?</div><br><br>

To explore these questions and see where the research is taking out, I set out  certain objectives to outline the trajectory of this work.<br><br>

<div class="subsubtitles">Main objective:</div>To reveal the diversity of body conceptions and configurations, emerged from xenotransplanted humans’ discussion.<br><br>

<div class="subsubtitles">Specific objectives:</div>
<div class="indent"> To conduct an exhaustive theoretical and bibliographical literature review.<br>
To perform a set of interviews with specialists in the field of my research topic.<br>
To generate knowledge based on the combination of the outcomes of the interviews and the theoretical and bibliographical literature.<br>
To think rhizomatically about the concepts and conclusions.<br>
To create a website where the intra-actions, displacements, connections and different paths and drifts throughout the research are captured, with the purpose of visually representing the body of work of the thesis with a new materialist and posthuman approach.</div><br><br>

My interest in the human body and its modifications or physical transformations has been generated from my personal experience with my own body while practising ballet for almost twenty years. I began to dance when I was four years old and I spent my childhood watching ballet plays instead of cartoons, making performances in my living room and since then I just can’t shake off the perception of my own bodily presence. My dream was to be a swan, the animal that in the famous Tchaikovsky ballet takes a human-like form by day and becomes a swan at night. I remember being in front of the mirror and trying to replicate the movement of the wings of a swan.<br><br>
My half-brother is a painter. In his early years as an artist, he met his girlfriend,a sculpture artist. Her art at that point was
related to mortality and materiality as when she was younger, she was diagnosed with a brain tumour, which she healed properly from, yet it defined a noticeable relationship with the terms of her own death. This fear or bodily finitude was translated into her artworks. As my brother’s and his girlfriend's art was my first approximation to the field of the Fine Arts and this has had a great impact on me as I can now observe from my own work and research interests.<br><br> 
My brother’s girlfriend would take life casting moulds of me as a child and then transform them into body horror sculptures. I remember very clearly that once I went to the art gallery where she was exhibiting her work and a copy of my bent legs was transformed into a hyper realistic birth of a mutilated baby. As well, once I helped him with a performance in which I had to wear a mask similar to the painting Ovo Nero from Figure 1 (Grün, 2003). It had four mutilated and joined faces which were the participants of the collective my brother was part of and whose name was the same as the painting. I remember that when I saw my reflection in the mirror, I confronted myself with the lack of my own face, that now was one with four faces, or fundamentally, another body.<br><br> 
When I was twenty-one years old, I got an undiagnosed injury which left me questioning my whole existence as an artist and performer. Transiting the unknown (not being able to dance) was tough and painful. Who would I be if I constructed my identity as a dancer swan-like-wanna-be? What if what I knew was only a little part of what life and bodily existence can mean in my life? At this moment I had to let go of my previous conceptions and mutate into what I am now actually, now writing this thesis.<br><br>  
In 2019 I decided to confront my own body, my autonomy, and the control I exert over it by trying to heal my injury, which years later would still bother me. I began to do scientific research and use myself as a guinea pig, or in other words, I would try to dictate my life from a biohacking perspective. Quantifying my bodily inputs and outputs, I became my own research project and was eager to know more about the self, the body, and the intimate construction of it until I found the source of it all: the DNA. Since we live in a world with great advances in genetic engineering technologies that allow physical transformations, my interest in the thesis research topic is an entanglement of life and performative experiences.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Theoretical framework: Weaving post-humanism and new materialism perspectives with xenotransplantation, genetic chimaerism and interspecies</div><br>
<div id="font-size"> The body understood as the inhuman, beyond the human and more than human, is directly related to the outside, to the world and to everything that surrounds it, breaking in this way with the exterior-interior dualistic division when thinking about it human-animal as oppositions (Rogoswka-Strangret, 2017). The concepts will be analysed from the ‘ethico-onto-epistem-ology’, posthumanism, new materialism and assemblage theories perspectives. I will aim to create, analyse, and define new conceptions based on interdisciplinary thinking in the process of Deleuzian becoming (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987). Breaking the biological barrier from observations of cartesian post-dualism that separates mind and body since I observe genetic chimaerism as a single being that entangles a double genomic identity. What Barad calls “matter and meaning are not separate elements” (Barad, 2007, p. 3) as of what it means to breed life and bodies in a lab. I will proceed to describe the theories and the bibliographical bases from where my research questions begin to get answers and generate new concepts.<br><br>
Posthumanism:<br><br> 
<div id="text-margin">[...] is often defined as a posthumanism and a post-anthropocentrism: it is "post" to the concept of the human and to the historical occurrence of humanism, both based, as we have previously seen, on hierarchical social constructs and human centric assumptions. Speciesism has turned into an integral aspect of the posthuman critical approach. The posthuman overcoming of human primacy, though, is not to be replaced with other types of primacies (such as the one of the machines). Posthumanism can be seen as a post-exclusivism: an empirical philosophy of mediation which offers a reconciliation of existence in its broadest significations. (Ferrando, 2013, p. 4)</div><br>
The word agency is understood as the ability to modify, intervene, displace, or serve to create something or a situation (Coole & Frost, 2010). Things always appear in relation to other things. Independent movement of any of these apparently separate bodies results in a change to generate other movements and tensions or stresses. Anthropocentricity is left behind as there is a hybrid between the human and the non-human. The non-human has to do with what surrounds us in our existence, in this particular study, the relationship with the genetically modified pigs. The distributive agency understands power as something much more complex and infinitely intertwined. Power is actually between all material bodies, both human and non-human or more than human, and therefore does not belong to the bodies independently, but occurs because material and human bodies always depend on each other. From the new materialist theory:<br><br>
<div id="text-margin">Agency is a core term used in new materialist theory, but different theorists put the notion to work in a myriad of ways. Rosi Braidotti refers to agency as synonymous with 'political subjectivity' in terms of her call for the creation of new forms of ethical agency (Braidotti, 2012, p. 31-5). Karen Barad stresses the non-human aspect of agency; insisting that agency is understood as 'an enactment.' Barad's theory is one that describes the physics of the observation of a world where: "Agential intra-actions are causal enactments." (2007, p. 176) For Barad, 'agency' is not an attribute of something or someone; rather it is the process of cause and effect in "enactment" (p. 214): "Agency is 'doing' or 'being' in its intra-activity. It is the enactment of iterative changes to particular practices – interactive reconfigurings of topological manifolds of space-time-matter relations ­– through the dynamics of intra-activity." (p. 178). Like Braidotti, Barad's position also argues that in and through the entanglements of matter, agency also refers to the "possibilities for worldly re-configurings". (Barad, 2012, p. 55, quoted in Colman, 2018, n.d.)</div><br>
New materialisms and posthuman thinking allow me to create new possibilities of my narration writing and to critically think from a broader sense the materialisation of it.  They propose a non-dualist and co-constitutive approach to understanding the intra-actions and agency of all concepts, terms, materials, organic and mechanical materiality that opens new paths of enquiry questions in and throughout the research process.<br><br>

The human does not necessarily have to be the centre of enquiry, but we can understand how the human connects with the non-human (Hood & Kraehe, 2017). This has to do with the theory of agency which focuses on what we can observe and what we can investigate and does not necessarily have to do with people or with the human, but rather with an interaction and intra-action (Barad, 2007). The assemblage theory is what causes assemblages. It can help us understand the idea of the body as a puzzle in which editing, inserting, and hiding DNA meets the concept of interspecies. The assemblages are what we go through and what helps us understand the relationships between complementary elements and what the axes of power are, as well as hierarchies and inequalities. How elements, or in this case, two different DNAs are connected with each other and co-habitate / live in the same body.<br><br>
Assemblies cause movement and give the ability to modify a situation, they can be dynamically configured and reconfigured (De Landa, 2006). This always has to do with the territory, limits, frontiers, borders, ways of doing things based on the configuration of this territory. The arrangement of material objects and the relationship between them, something that invites you or provokes something determined, how objects affect a future that opens the possibility of creating or not an action to create various movements, possibilities and tensions based on the various assemblies.<br><br>
Then I can say that the context is an intra-action with agency power in the future (Barad, 2003). In the assemblage, what matters is not only the final process of the things that come together to generate an assemblage, but also the process in which things occur (De Landa, 2016; Acuto & Curtis, 2013). The becoming that allows an agency to take place. Agency is also a product that consists of composing various pieces together and that conjunction allows us to do something. It is not only the product but also the process which takes shape, or one could say that it is the process in which that product is established and generated. Agency can always change; it never has a finished character, and it has different multiple dynamic intensities and are in constant motion (Deleuze & Parnet, 1980; Fox & Aldred, 2015).<br><br> 
Introducing ‘Long live the New Flesh’ as a hypothesis, a bio-constructed body, is an attempt to resolve the thanatophobia and anxiety through an embodied performance (Haddow, 2021). With the use of xenotransplantation, the research will explore forms, conceptions, and concepts to determine the knowledge of this type of body / human without precedent.

</figure>

What results from xenotransplantation is genetic chimaerism. A chimera is an organism who has two populations of genetically distinct cells or two populations of cells with two different genetic heritages, meaning: two DNAs (Norton & Zehner, 2008). Talking about the subject of mythology, a chimera is a fire-breathing creature who was the descendant of Typhon and Echidna (both themselves half-serpent, half-human creatures). Animals and mythological topics were particularly popular subjects in Etruscan art and particularly in the bronze work ‘Chimera of Arezzo’ of Cosimo de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany (Gáldy, 2003) as you can see in figure 15. The definition of chimera is:<br><br>

<div class="indent">This monstrous beast was first mentioned in the Iliad, where Homer describes it as a hybrid of three different creatures: a lion, a goat and a snake. The beast’s head was fire-breathing; the Chimera was killed by the noble Bellerophon, son of Glaucus, as the Gods predicted. The Chimera is also mentioned in Hesiod’s Theogony and in Virgil’s Aeneid. Servius Honoratus refers that the creature was originally from Lycia, where there was a namesake volcano with lions on top, pastures for goats at mid height, and snakes slithering at the bottom. This is where the myth is said to be born. Plutarch suggested instead that Chimera was the name of a pirate who adorned the sails of his ship with the images of a lion, a goat and a Montpellier snake. (Muse Firenze, n.d.)</div><br><br>

From a genetic perspective there are diverse ways to make a chimera. One is by performing xenotransplantation or using xenografts, which is a proposition that till now carries within it a lot of risks because the host’s immune system may cause the organ to be rejected. Another method is to begin at the embryonic level, introducing one animal’s cells into the embryo of another and letting them grow together into a hybrid body (Moran et. al, 2021). One more technique is by mixing human blood serum with pig cells which I will further explain at the conclusion of the interview with Benjamin Smith. The researchers on genetics and hybridisation Lachezar Nikolov and Miltos Tsiantis describe that:<br><br> 

<div id="text-margin">One way to study the genetic basis for trait diversity is to apply a transgenic approach and introduce genes of interest from a donor into a recipient species. Such interspecies gene transfer (IGT) is based on the premise that if a gene is causal to the morphological divergence of the two species, the transfer will endow the recipient with properties of the donor. Recent technical advances in the field of xenotransplantation and chimera research now allow the manufacture of human organs in animals and consequently the creation of human–animal chimeras. Due to the serious organ scarcity, the medical demands are clear, notably for organ transplantation. Nonetheless, such a viewpoint creates significant legal and ethical concerns. (Nikolov & Miltos, 2015, p. 1)</div><br><br>

The implications of designing chimeras with human genetic material raises questions of how much of a  “human” the rendered creature is. Philip Karpowicz and his research colleagues argued that<br>
<div id="text-margin"> If such a chimera exhibited signs of emergent human mental capacities, conducting biomedical experiments upon it might be essentially equivalent to conducting the same experiments on a human person. Human dignity would be undermined by the transfer of emergent and super cellular psychological human functions into research subjects that consequently possess the same capacities themselves. (Karpowicz et al., 2004, pp. 333-334).</div><br><br>

Dignity arguments fail for a similar reason: it is difficult to articulate a consistent ethical principle that explains why, and in what way, the creation of human-animal interspecies is a violation of human dignity, while other types of human-animal mixing are supposedly unproblematic (Huther, 2009). The ethical issues raised by xenotransplantation include the limitation of genetic diseases transmissible from animals to humans, the crossing of the inter-species barrier, and social acceptance of the practise. Furthermore, xenotransplantation intends to make significant changes in legal aspects, particularly in terms of regulations governing research and access to organ donation (Lesage, 2022).

The first transgenic pig was designed and produced in the middle of the eighties  injecting copies of human growth hormone genes into fertilised eggs (Koo et. al, 2012). Pig farms have grown to be enormous and commercial pig production businesses in order to attain these high numbers. Each year, more than one billion pigs are slaughtered throughout the world. At the beginning of the applied research on transgenic pigs was for agricultural purposes but now pigs are mostly utilized for human consumption, but they also provide skin, fat, and other materials for apparel, processed food components, cosmetics, and other medicinal purposes, moreover as well for xenotransplantation (de la Casa, 2017).  Pigs went from being companion species to becoming cyborgs or technology in itself (Haraway, 2003). These animals that grow in laboratories, in pathogens free both the cyborg animals and dogs in particular and cybernetic machines in particular genetic engineering technologies (Fishman et. al, 2012) and companion species or pigs that are designed in the era where genomes can be acquired, designed, manufactured.<br><br>
To optimise the benefits of xenotransplantation, the most recent advances in several sectors of research, such as animal science, biotechnology, genomics, and so on, must be used. These elements interact and complement one another, resulting in valuable breeding. The possible spread of pathogenic microorganisms from the organ host pig to the recipient is the most essential issue when using pigs for xenotransplantation (Johnson, 2022). To eliminate this danger, pigs should be kept free of certain bacteria, fungus, protozoa, and viruses that might cause diseases for humans.<br><br>

</figure>
Even though the organs from a pig have a similar size and look like human ones, the rejection risk of xenotransplanted material has been an issue that scientists were confronted to tackle. Genetic engineering technologies such as CRISPR-Cas9 with the help of immunosuppressive therapies open the door to avoid the potential rejection of the organ that is grown in an animal host (Haddow, 2021). The human that would receive the organ can make it recognised as a part of itself due to the fact that the DNA is the same as the person. This procedures of adding and subtracting or thinking the body as a replaceable and interchangeable thing related to the ‘The Ship of Theseus’ paradox which “is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object” (Madison, 2020, p. 89).<br><br> 

The history and relationship between humans and the eagerness to control over the environment from micro to macro and the things that surround them is an old story (Webb, 1959). This brings to the light the thought of the body as a database driven machine, where even the biological essence of it all, the DNA, can be controlled, manipulated, and most importantly constructed by the data that constitutes identities. Now with the scientific application of Big Data and health research questions the idea of freedom as the all the genetic database that has information to do with the construction of bodies and the possibility to make hybrid creatures be created (EIT Health, n.d.). Health Big Data is shared knowledge of organic material, human and non-human, which then a computer reads, processes, reads and allows humans to shape by their agential realism of its own evolution.<br><br>

Darwinian species storyline and networks are a thing from the past using methods of quantification of the body. If the body becomes a measurable thing in which adding and subtracting parts of it based on biometric information, what does this mean for the constitution of the human and any organic material? Ulfried Reichardt and Regina Schober wrote the following related to the construction of bodies and data:<br><br>

<div class="indent"> The use of data in conceptualizing the human body has been present in narratives of the self for much longer than current discourses on self-quantification would suggest. What Don DeLillo depicts in his 1984 novel White Noise already indicates the measurability of biometric data in relation to individual risk assessment, while it may not be self-tracking as we know it today. Jack Gladney, the protagonist of DeLillo’s novel, exposed to toxic fumes, tries to reach certainty about his health status – a desire that is denied to him. The novel thus exemplifies a central paradox in relation to quantified self-experience: Although numbers may seem reliable, they simultaneously create more uncertainty. While numbers provide the illusion of objectivity, like DeLillo’s protagonist, we are always left with the question of “What does this mean?” Personal data has to be interpreted to generate meaningful narratives about ourselves. Yet, what this passage also addresses is the ambivalence of probabilistic knowledge and the incalculable effects of predictions on individuals. How much data do we want to aggregate about our bodies? Under which circumstances can too much data generate problems (for example, when a prediction becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy)? (Reichardt & Schober, 2020, p. 7).</div><br>

Genetic engineering technologies allow the use of bodies as true interfaces between man and animal, making the relationship between both more indirect and complex. The complexity, density and amplitude that it has acquired poses the risk of isolating and completely enclosing the human, blocking his perception of what nature has offered to itself. To avoid this, a clarification effort is required that makes it comprehensible and controllable; in other words, to make it transparent. The layers of visibility and invisibility of the man by becoming chimeras makes us question the belief that our biological identities are interchangeable.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Methodology</div><br>

The paper is in search of both conceptual clarification, as well as sharing ideas and ways of doing research based on a bibliographic study and on generating knowledge with and from the sum of interviews with specialists in the field of my research topic: Didier Coeurnelle, vice-president of the French Transhumanist Association Technoprog - co-founder of International Longevity Alliance. Jaime del Val, a post-queer philosopher and metahumanist, transdisciplinary and digital artist, activist and ontohacker. Jaime  promotes the Metabody Project, Forum and Institute and the Reverso association. They develop transdisciplinary projects at the convergence of the arts, technologies, critical theory, and activism. Their projects, which have been presented in more than 30 countries in Europe, North and South America, Asia, and Africa, propose redefinitions of the body, perception, and space, questioning digital control and systems of violence and normativity and mobilising in its place a formless body (Metabody, n.d). The third person that was interviewed is a pioneering xenotransplantation researcher and heart transplant surgeon that will remain anonymous and will use a fictitious name which is Benjamin Smith. The three interviews lasted from 60 to 90 minutes and they were audio recorded and transcripted.<br><br>

The research is proposed from a post-qualitative approach. It aims to generate the bases that allow projecting the knowledge and experiences that are shared within them. They are not proposed ‘against’, but ‘from’ based on interviews based on an entanglement of voices. The research process and interviews will entangle what Deleuze and Guattari (1987) refer to as a rhizome, an assemblage of voices, objects, subjects, ideas, and structures that move in dynamic motion performing waves of intensities that create new understandings and meanings.<br><br> 

By means of paradigms based on entanglements that “opening the body to connections that presuppose an entire assemblage” (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. 177) the research and the researcher are in the process of becoming (Clarke & Parsons, 2013). The becoming voice and the concept of time-duration show a past entanglement of bodies or sequences of phenomena and the simultaneity of empirical existence of them at a specific and precise moment in time. I will use Mazzei’s concept of a “Voice without Organs […] as a voice that does not emanate from a singular subject but is produced in an enactment among research-data-participants-theory-analysis.” (Mazzei, 2013, p. 2).<br><br> 

A present voice that is bounded and it does not belong to a singular subject but to the collective forces of the voices and their material discursive forces, the precedent to a voice without subject (Mazzei, 2016). Subjectivity and the construction of knowledge is understood as multidimensional, collective, and plural: a collective voice.  As well, I would take a rhizomatic post-coding analysis (St Pierre & Jackson, 2014) approach and perspective as “open and connectable in all its dimensions; it is detachable, reversible, susceptible to constant modification” (Deleuze & Guattari, 1987, p. 12). The questions that I intend to do are conferred not from an illusory objectivity and a predetermined a priori, where rigour is related to reflexivity, but avoiding totalitarian understandings. It is what O’Sullivan calls the construction of the new as “an ‘escape’ from the fixed habits and impasses of the present through recourse to a ‘time’ undetermined by that present” contained within the possibility of a different future (O’Sullivan, 2011, p. 93).<br><br> 

For instance, in the course of the enquiry process, I was supposed to interview someone that wrote a book and researched about xenotransplantation. She was very eager at the beginning to be interviewed and was flattered and enthusiastic about it. At the last moment, the day before the interview she told me that she thought she wasn’t not the right person for me to interview. Instead, she said that she didn’t have much else to say about what she has already written, and she recommended to me someone else to be interviewed. What happened to her voice? Was this all she wanted to say? Does the rigidity of her becoming-voice (Mazzei, 2016) take away from her the possibility of discovering new ideas on the subject? If research becomes itself from existential questions that we are confronted with in life, is her stopping from talking to me a resistance to new questions that could lead to new knowledge?<br><br>

If I’m the selector of the person that I think is relevant for my thesis, what does control have to do with this? And what do I think is important to select relevant data? Meanwhile, while writing this thesis, I realised how myself was in the constant process of becoming and would have to ethically perform my intrinsically role in the investigation, meaning having<br>
<div class="indent"> the ability for discourse and conversation to produce new ethical realities and, in turn, to be guided by that productive process. Performative ethics focuses on the communicative activity involved in creating and shaping moral futures. Hence, it lies outside of the normative– descriptive spectrum of theories defined by what is and wh at ought to be and creates a space for experimenting with what might be. (Edwards & Kirkham, 2014, p. 486).</div><br>

Therefore, I should speak of the active and involved creation of data by the researcher, since all decisions are based on the researcher’s subjectivities (needs, tastes, preferences, what appears and what does not, etc.). This does not mean that the researcher controls everything (because it is impossible), nor that we cannot allow ourselves to get lost in the research, or to be open to the unexpected and the unknown in order to construct knowledge and theory theorising from there. Post-qualitative research and rhizomatic methodology bring to my research process the quality of linking ideas and concepts freely without the pressure of looking for only one conclusion. They allow me to let the collective subjectivity of the collection of voices that I selected as bibliographical material and the interviews I made as a self transformative-oriented  ontology of the research in itself and the outcome of it  (St. Pierre, 2017 & 2019). Post-qualitative research with rhizomatic methodology focuses on the theory calling for a philosophy of immanence that abandons the use of “be” and replaces it with the conjunction “and”. It creates the opportunities of a constant becoming of ongoing relations moving “away from epistemology (knowledge) and instead focus on ontology (being)” (Lind, 2019, p.32).<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Research methods and decisions of a rhizomatic methodology</div><br>
Approaching my research with a rhizomatic perspective to understand my investigation topic and all of the resources of information that surrounded and had to do with it, I began to write words in papers to connect what I considered a relevant reference to write about as you can see in Figure 18. But the issue I came across with is that I was writing with permanent ink and a pen, which then didn’t allow me to move the words in the paper, a non-interchangeable material. So, I thought that perhaps it would be better to put all the content of the thesis into a website as in figure 19 where the content could be interactive and strive for a  non-linear index. Rhizomatic thinking allowed me to evaluate myself as the researcher being in the in-betweenness of the research topic, its intra-action, in constant movement and becoming escaping reductive rationalism.<br><br>
How I selected my interviewees was rhizomatic in itself by means of a network of relationships. The first participant was recommended to me by a person I wanted to interview but told me he didn’t have time but said that Didider Cournelle was a great candidate to ask questions about my research topic. Jaime del Val was suggested to me to interview by an ex classmate of mine who worked together with the candidate some years ago in a performance and that was considered after reading his work to have a lot of academic research done related to body configurations. The third candidate was discovered by doing research on scientific papers related to xenotransplantation and was precisely chosen due to his diligence and many years in-the-making work in the field of transplantation and the origins of xenotransplantation and who is still conducting research on the topic. With Didier Cournelle and Benjamin Smith the questions were related to xenotransplantation and its relation to their expertise and they were asked during the interview (<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/13-w4iUg31uUuAPdhcP8Bz0h8AZByEK00?usp=sharing">see attachments</a>). With Jaime del Val things were different since he requested to previously have the questions via email (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IibsBCcIrspsR36n36dKYamZEszHP0d89fjkG0lvZ1U/edit?usp=sharing">see attachments</a>) and he very thoughtfully replied.<br><br>

The voices, the data and the intra-actions, body action and intertwining of the assemblages of agential voices from the interviewees shape a part of the thesis body of work. The voices are built together and the resultant data is built on a website (see reference) where its own network and the entanglement of the concepts and theories that I come across appear. The voices work as living systems (Parsons, 1937) that through my choices and agency and the later data analysis I made, they become related to each other based on my own subjectivity. The possible outcomes of the interviews are four because there will be one for each of them and one of my own. As well I will leave a blank editable sheet for people to be able to add their own comments and conclusions about the research topic. The website will be approached as an expressed body-becoming and as a platform where encounters between a bodily form and agencies that are non-human interact.<br><br> 

In Figure 20 I present a screenshot via Zoom with Didider Cournelle and in Figure 21 another with the interview I conducted with Jaime del Val via email. As the third interviewee wants to remain anonymous, obviously I cannot present similar evidence, but rather the transcript of the complete interview that can be found in the following annexs (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSNN3y-7P4zIfji-49vgXFZ2_Zj-nYDQSUT7ElGfKtI/edit?usp=sharing">see reference</a>).<br><br>

I chose to design a website and put all the content in such media due to thinking of it as a good way to achieve a visual representation of my thesis. The web is a network space that allows to display the entanglement of all concepts and ideas. It is a body of work where many languages live as its source of existence is a fusion of coding languages which are: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python. The coding can be seen as the genotype of the body and the visual expression as the phenotype. Superposition of layers co-exist in cells looking like points of access to the content creating a new material where the summary’s hierarchy does not matter, but what does, is the in-between links and the way they relate to each other thinking.<br><br>

When readers hover over (put the mouse over) the chapters of the thesis and the names of the interviewees the content will reveal itself as the website users will have human agency over the non-human. The interviews and the bibliographical references are situated in the corners of the website because that is what framed the body of work of the thesis as external sources. The users will also be able to submit comments and their own outcome in the chapter ‘Interviews: Entanglement of voices without organs’ as its a rhizomatic approach to knowledge construction. Animations run by themselves as giving the website and matter that has its own life.<br><br> 

The fonts used are two because it reflects back on the cross-species or interspecies bodies that are constructed by two genetic materials that cohabitate in one body. As well, the design of one looks like it is constructed from blocks and the other one is a monospace font which also works like the previously mentioned but as well the space in between letters is the same.<br><br>

</figure>

The interviews were transcripted and the analysis method for dismembering the content of its elements was focused on the discourses and the themes that I considered relevant for the thesis. I used Natural Language Processing (NLTK, n.d) with Python, which is a programming language to realise a speech or discourse analysis of the words that were repeated more frequently in the interviews. NLP allowed me to design a cartography of words, analysing linguistic structure and categorising text and concepts. I omitted the words that were connectors and I highlighted the words that expressed adjectives and subjects, because this allows you to focus precisely on the basic concepts that have been touched on and sometimes have been reiterated. The data organisation enabled structures and assemblages because the words are linked and have agency on each other as you can see in figures 22, 23 and 24.<br><br>

As well I made a thematic analysis myself to study the components that the code skipped and were still relevant to highlight to discover new connections and intra-actions of words that I initially didn’t look upon. The entanglement and assemblages of the voices of the participants in the research process, as you can see in Figure 18 and 19 (see reference), placed me in an active position and role, and I was able to build the entanglement. Knowledge was constructed upon space-time structuralisation or a network of subjectivities. Being proactively open to change and displacements for the elaboration of the research in itself during its process,  I used a posthumanist and new materialist approach to connect the words and concepts as you can see in Table 1 (see reference). The construction of the intra-actions is coming from a non-dualist approach, meaning the body in relation to something else, but instead, how it is connected to everything that surrounds it.<br><br>
	
This allowed me to reflect back on my own research and the process that it itself is involved in and how new data is built as a new body of work from a social construction point of view. All the content and the elements operating in the research will be made available as new material in a website that leaves room for new interpretations. The result of this process is a textual reconstruction and reconfiguration of reality and it proposes layers of transparency that build it and upon it during the research process.<br><br>

Based on the transcripts and notes, I created a new reality and body of work that I, the researcher, interpreted, linked and constructed and that now is materialised as a representation of  the conjunction of voices without organs. I applied the post-qualitative approach not only by evading the words that have no relevance based on words counter but as well I performed a discursive filter from the quantified words highlighting only the ones that are conditional and I considered based on my own subjectivity to be relevant.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Theorising data, rather than theory</div><br>
	Theorising is the moulding, shaping and/or forming of a theory or theories about a specific topic. Theorizing rather than theory and transforming the data from the interviews and theoretical papers into a new space of reflexivity that allows exchange, pushes relationality that is necessary to generate science and knowledge (Mckinley, 2020). Theorizing produces a new material and articulated body of knowledge so that the researcher remains in the state of in-betweenness. Theorizing not from a static state or approach, but instead letting the fluctuations and their variations of movements during the research period and its entangled tensions lead its own process and rhizomatic diverse outcomes and conclusions.

Xenotransplantation is such a controversial topic and it’s very important to denote that meanwhile doing research i understood that the subjective opinions (or voices) should all be included and heard because we are talking about sensitive topics related to animal and human rights, and he meaning, the creation and the extension of human and non-human lifeforms. Theorizing from different and sometimes quite opposite points of view let me understand my research topic on a global scale.<br><br>


I didn’t conduct the research process by seeking a fixed conclusion but instead I looked for reflections. What I realized during the research process is that more I investigated about the topic, more questions were generated based on the research itself:<br><br>

<div class="indent">-Is human life more relevant than any other life forms? Why yes or no?<br>
- How much will we be able to replace body parts to extend lives and / or borrow biological time from xenotransplantation?<br>
- If other species kill each other for food and protection, what does xenotransplantation and taking the survival of the fittest theory (reference) into human hands mean for the future of biodiversity and transpecies relations?<br>
- If we get to a point that the rejection of xenotransplantation organs is totally reduced, does this mean that we could become closer to animals genetically speaking or are we vanishing the meaning of the human species?<br>
- What are the variables or the intra-actions that bound the biological and psychosocial aspects of the construction and configurations of a body?<br>
- How much can we reject our own biological predestination and body?<br>
- How much does it affect what we think about ourselves more than what we “actually” are?<br>
- How can this dissertation might later on become a PhD research topic to keep on inquiring about?<br></div>

    <h2>Didier Cournelle</h2>
    <p>Didier Cournelle: The average lifespan is rising for people all around the world but the maximal lifespan is not rising. Big Data in healthcare is a tool that binds all the information from quantified bodies and what can bind bodies information and the relation to one another. A web of thousands and millions of input data from humans all around the world. The issue with Big Data is the shared knowledge if private companies decide to not make public or share their research health data that could and or should be a common public good. There’s no public organization in the world that has officially the goal to fight against diseases of old age or that make people live longer and big companies like Google are working in the field of genetics and rejuvenation but there’s still no big progress. Altos Labs is something very new, they work specially in the rejuvenation of cells and they are starting with big names in the genetic field there is hope that it would be useful. <br><br>

Gene therapy, cell rejuvenation or other body modification practices will have to do with having a longer life but still it will not be enough to trick it. Your body is changing all the time and from his point of view, the fact that xenotransplantation is put to practice on humans does not change the definition of the concept of ‘human being’ and does not make it something else. Our body can be seen as an interchangeable object in which you can add or subtract parts of or to it but would still remain the same as in the ‘Ship of Theseus’ paradox. The quest of life is in itself to have a longer and healthier life using all technological progress to realize this. <br><br>

Why is it good  to live longer and healthier? Living longer and health care is positive in many aspects because we have more time to love each other and to discover things. We have more time for empathy and so on but it's also good for society in general because  when people live longer, they are more careful with each other. They are more careful with the environment and maybe even more important because they are less violent. Technological progress can be a very positive, but also very dangerous thing relating to the history of humanity, but today is also the most dangerous day of the history of humanity. From the interviewee’s point of view xenotransplantation is very promising but it is not yet to be used against ageing because of course ageing is a multiple aspect phenomenon and therefore we die of diseases related to old age. It might provide a better quality of life but not longevity per se.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="column">
    <h2>Jaime del Val</h2>
    <p>From a metahumanist point of view we should raise questions about the abuse of animals that are bred for xenotransplantation as well as other forms of animal sacrifice. Since the healthcare system and the idea that we have to extend human life using any technological means is based on the conception of human supremacy over other species. Not only that but an elitist human supremacy because the human lives that need to be extended as much as possible would be mainly of the rich euro-white-anglo-american. It is related with an implicit eugenics that ignores the fact that this human suprematism is grounded on a massive planetary killing and it's associated with an heteronormative oppression that paradoxically leads us to mass extinction. It all is the same domination system, expansion of nation states, empires, imperialism, etc.<br><br> 

The governing healthcare system ignores the structural cause of most of the diseases,  that is the result of toxic lifestyles that human beings have created for themselves and that originate in bipedalism and agriculture. The result of this is the current overpopulation of the earth. This as well has to do with man's obsession with technological progress that is against the flows of the earth when playing with biodiversity and creating evolutionary paralysis in the entire planet that entails a human un-enhancement. Big Data culture has resulted in the annihilation of ‘Body Intelligence’ because it atrophies the sensory motor and movements. It makes us incapable of listening to the body, of varying our movement and senses, of relating to the world and its indeterminacy. We are making ourselves dependent on algorithmic, pharmaceutical, and other technical and technological systems that are actually at the core or our discomforts and are part of the extinction system. We are creating a ‘Planetary Holocaust’ so devastating that we are threatening our own species.<br><br> 

From this perspective the notion of genetic chimeras does not matter because we already are chimeras. It is possible to imagine a future in which transpecies families of humans and non-humans are an established fact and all animal abuse is abolished with a much lower human population. The interviewee could think of the possibility of having xenotransplantation from our transpecies kinship when they naturally or accidentally die, just as is done with human transplantation, as perhaps the only acceptable option. Then xenotransplantation could help further undo the species gap, but this is of course far from what happens today.</p>

  <div class="column">
    <h2>Benjamin Smith</h2>
    <p>The participant was involved with the first-ever heart transplantation surgeon Dr. Chris Barnard, and he was taking care of the patients after surgery after working on the preservation of hearts for transplantation. He realized back then that the shortage of organs was a big issue in the transplantation field. Firstly he did trials on baboons but later on he became interested in doing research on pigs as hosts and donors due to logistical reasons and as well from an immunological point of view they are much closer to humans. Since then he does not do any clinical work anymore but he does work testing transgenic pigs for xenotransplantation by transplanting a heart or a kidney from the pig into a monkey or a baboon. Human serum and pig cells are tested to see if the human serum kills the pig cells in the lab so the human serum will kill the pig organ if that particular genetic modification is rejected in the serum cell combination.<br><br>  

A human heart transplant would take seven days to be rejected by the recipient. Instead the genetically engineered organs from the pigs are transplanted in young baboons which will take five minutes to have an immunological response against it. The bred pigs have ten genetic modifications before the be can donors and the more they are engineered to be compatible with the recipient the less you have to expose the patient to immunosuppressant drugs therapy. In the lab you can structure antigens on a pig cell so the patients no longer have antibodies against the pig because the animal it’s designed to suit that particular patient. There are all sorts of potential ways that eventually will make pig organs a much better source of organs than human ones for the majority of patients.<br><br>  

Babies have a weaker immunological response and their immune system is much more flexible and plastic. They have a lower response to both pig cells and to human cells than adults do and those patients do better than any other patients with any type of organ transplant. A heart xenotransplantation done on babies could allow them to extend their lives while they wait for another baby human donor to die. There are a lot of adult patients who will be dead or be taken off the waiting list within five years because they are no longer suitable. Xenotransplantation could be a great solution for kidney diseased patients that are in dialysis treatment because their organs deteriorate at such a rapid pace that putting a pig's kidney meanwhile they wait for a human resource could keep them alive.<br><br>  

Pigs for xenotransplantation are bred in very clean facilities so that they won't carry any infections with them. The staff who look after them put on a sort of space suit every day so they don't give the pig any infections for themselves. The pigs are tested every month to make sure they've not got any infectious organisms that you could transfer with the graft whereas most with human donors you have literally a few hours to check. The transgenic pigs will be housed under very clean, ideal conditions, given the perfect diet and instead of being slaughtered by having their throats cut like in other food facilities they will be anaesthetized and they will die under the anaesthesia when taking the organs out. So from a pig's point of view it's a much more humane life and death than the average pig.<br><br> 

The psychological and sociological aspects of a genetic chimerism based on pig to human xenotransplantation is what is more relevant than the concept of a genetic chimera in itself and it’s similar to when a human to human organ transplantation is performed. In adults the reactions of xenotransplantation could be managed with a conscious and mature approach with psychotherapy. In children the topic should be supervised in a private and discreet manner so they won't be exposed to the possibility of bullying or other psychological problems. They don’t need to know about the details until they are older enough to understand and accept what was performed on their bodies to preserve their lives. Most people would accept xenotransplantation if it's going to be life-saving for them. Patients would accept the doubts they have in their mind if they know it's the only way they can stay alive even though they may still have some deep-seated concerns that they're not entirely human.</p>

</div>

<div style="font-size: 1rem"><br><br>After considering what was manifested in the interviews, my own reflections about the topic are the following: Man is the only animal that is aware of the certainty that he is going to die, so there are great concerns that have to do with extending life and fighting against diseases seeking a subjective good life quality. The longevity of life, although it has extended to part of the population of the planet, has not increased significantly or radically. “Long live the New Flesh” is a concept that has not to do with longevity itself, but with the idea of a human borrowing extra years from becoming a genetic chimera by using xenotransplantation. The United States Food and Drug Administration allows xenotransplantation research conducted in research facilities only if the mutations can’t be transmitted to reproductive cells, therefore the offspring of the chimeras will not have a genetic alteration (Benjamin, personal communication, 6th June 2022). Even though techno progressivism has altruistic ideals to put into practice, those to make technologies available for everyone is somehow questionable.<br><br> 

We have to see the long term effects of the results of pig to human xenotransplantation and I believe that it won’t be possible without testing the organs in even more humans and not in baboons. This also makes me question how much we can quantify our bodies, till where can we add, subtract and any parts of the body. Also I can reflect on the concept of ‘divide and conquer’ as the human obsession with controlling himself and everything that surrounds him can now be taken with the help of genetic engineering technologies to define DNA, the source of all living lifeforms. This possibility of replacing our body with a new body can give rise to the idea of avoiding death, that is, that the human being could somehow 'be eternal'.<br><br>

Trying to define what body type or configuration is generated in xenotransplantation brought to my attention even more questions than answers. How much can humans extend themselves by putting their DNA into other living forms, in this case pigs that become hosts of our DNA to generate organs for xenotransplantation? Does this make us become closer to animals or grow more apart from other humans? The genetic chimeras that result from xenotransplantation risk having more struggles to know who they might be themselves, which is their identity and this is a very personal and subjective journey. Even though we humans try to control our life path, we can do it within a limited time and space frame. The possibility that more people in the world can have a healthier and longer life can allow us to have an optimistic vision about the care that human beings will and could give to the planet, to themselves and to other species. <br><br>

From this thoughts I propose a new concept of body that is generated upon the creation of a xenotransplanted human:<br><br>

<b>Xeno-in-bodied:</b> The meaning of bodied is “having a body of a specified kind — used in combination” (reference). From this premise I argue that the body is seen as a quantifiable matter and can be self-organized or organised by agency forces from humans even at a genetic level. We are striving for designed bodies where DNA is put in another host and the human is genetically living in another body. A body that is gestated in a lab and it grows inside an animal, a non-human body. This reflects on a question: are we our DNA? To explain the term ‘Xeno-in-bodied’ I used the term ‘xeno’ because the organs develop outside the human, ‘in’ because it comes back to the human body, and ‘bodied’ because it’s a quantifiable organised and controlled matter, a voluntary body modification of the individual. The transferred encoded data becomes a new flesh in which structures are interchangeable from outside sources. The body can be understood as a systematic organism with modular structures with mechanical assistance. The xenotransplanted human is a new material that is an assemblage directed and the. The reconfiguration of the human body that is created upon using the pig as a technological tool that is inserted into the human by xenotransplantation, changes the definition of pigs and the notion of their animal nature as well. A limitless and boundless encoded body emerges among the expansion of DNA xeno-living where sub-organisms create a whole-organism system. This creates a report to ecological and evolutionary success, in which human supremacy is a core concept of the created body and animal sacrifice is due to speciesism hierarchy. If we get to a point where immunological response from xenotransplants is nonexistent, the biological barrier that exists in between transgenic pigs and humans will disappear.<br><br> 

<b>Ambivalent body configuration from a social standpoint:</b> Socially speaking, pigs can be seen as repulsive or dirty animals. There are two important issues related to both the societal and individual response to xenotransplantation and the xenotransplanted person. The individual may be aware that this is the only resource that will allow him to survive, in which case his positive reaction will contribute to the success of the surgical intervention. This can vary according to the life experience, ideas and emotions of each individual. On the other hand, the collective social reaction towards a xenotransplanted being will vary rhizomatically. For example: a person whose criterion is to equate animals with human beings will reject any intervention of this type, considering it cruel towards the former. The opposite will happen if human life is considered the most relevant in the chain of species. In any case, the xenotransplanted human will be seen as an ambivalent and new being. In addition, one of the possible results is mockery, bullying or bewilderment towards the unknown.<br><br>

<b>The age of genetic-chimeras:</b> The creation of human-pig chimeras highlights speciesism as an ethical ideal and the concept of human and animal dignity. Scientific possibilities allow the combination of human and non-human species and that does not rely on categorization into human and nonhuman categories. As xenotransplantation procedures progress the definitions of human will mutate and vary depending on the immunological response. The xenotransplanted person will be considered in the scientific field as a human being, and will not be treated as an animalistic creature. The idea of the mythological chimeric creature will lose its power as xenotransplantation becomes a not so extraordinary process. This changed the human-animal relationship to the core, where the pigs now are not companion species anymore but they are a tool for human life extension.<br><br>   

<b>Long Live the New Flesh:</b> Another concept that emerges is a post-cyborg body. Petkovsek & Zalec say that “cyborgization is the connection of mechanic and organic, as two autonomous systems benefiting the host system. Contemporary technology can combine the artificial mechanic parts and the artificial biological parts in some medical operations such as a sex limb change, prosthetic ears or skin implantation made by using 3D bioprinting. In this way cyborgization spread from combining artificial machine systems to connecting the body with artificial systems, where both the biological and mechanical can be artificially produced by technology. Still, this does not include transplantation or any chemical influence to the psychological or emotional state of a human” (Petkovsek & Zalec, 2021).<br><br>

What can be argued about the premises of the previously mentioned authors is that transplantation does not take part in the cyborgization process, but xenotransplantation does. Due to the fact that the pigs that are being bred for hosting human organs are technology in itself, the xenotransplanted human would become a post-cyborg even though the organ is a biological material. A xenotransplanted human would not be separate from the designed organ which is technology in itself but he would be actually a part of it. This body is thoughtfully controlled and escapes randomness and nature’s adversity. Genetically engineering technologies create a different quest for immortalisation where death due to degenerative organs is not inevitable. If a new organ is needed, it can be created in a laboratory and will replace the failed organ.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Final thoughts</div><br>  
My thesis research contributes to the field of study with the idea that xenotransplantation can be understood not only from a medical or pharmaceutical approach but from many other onto-epistemological and social perspectives. Some of the lines of research that can be generated from my thesis are:<br><br>

<div class="indent">
- Comparison between the benefits of xenotransplantation in contrast to the use of 3D printed organs or human-to-human organs transplant.<br> 
- How the legal and bioethical framework and the laws related to xenotransplantation should accompany the new processes and procedures and also the type of experimentation that can be put into practise related to interspecies research methods and human-animal genetic chimeras.<br> 
- How human supremacy can be considered as an absolute truth or something questionable from the point of view of speciesism theories.<br> 
- If xenotransplanted humans should be study material for future research, experimentation and trials.<br>
- If these investigations are carried out by private companies, the possibility arises that the body becomes a commodification and body parts are manufactured like a factory machine. In this case we can argue about what would be the benefits of conducting research performed by public institutions. Perhaps this may guarantee access to xenotransplantation for people of all social classes.<br><br></div>

With respect to the concept of the human body the contributions of my thesis research outcomes are: The idea that living beings are quantifiable matter and that humans can create a living being that has their DNA outside themselves, then come back to themselves in a refreshed manner and version. Organs can have an upgrade in which a new practise for the quest for immortalisation affects longevity and quality of life. From a xenotransplanted human, considering that part of the transplanted tissue has pig’s DNA, the recipient’s body can no longer be defined as entirely human. It is a genetic chimera, it is a cross-species being, a new creature that has extended the concept of survival or nature vs nurture. Humans shaped the environment from the micro to the macro level to even shape themselves and it becomes a new ontology. A body that can be understood as an interchangeable machine that previously was self-organised by itself, then it’s xeno-organised and then becomes a reorganisation or reconfiguration of itself responding to the integration of the new organ. Theorising about this new concept of human, and human in relation to other species, which were before companion species and are now a bio-technology for life expansion, redefine human-animal-machine and interspecies relationships which originate from a xenotransplanted  human. Man is the only creature that can create technology, and that can include the best or worst aspects of creation and destruction of ourselves and our environment.<br><br> 
What I learned throughout my research process is that everything can be mutable, ideas change and are metabolised if you open the door to accept that the investigation itself leads to fields in which extraordinary can become something possible.  At the beginning I was obsessively trying to define the configuration generated from a xenotransplanted human, but later on when I began to conduct the interviews I realized that there are many factors and points of views related to such a controversial matter. The diverse and sometimes opposite opinions of the interviewees about the research topic bring to the light how important it is as a researcher to understand how it is always in-between the research process and let the methodology and the investigation find themselves rhizomatically. It is necessary to respect and understand ideas and beliefs based on the personal experience and academic and professional work of each respondent.<br><br>

Having Sara Carrasco Segovia as a tutor has allowed the formation and moulding of my thesis to have a frame in which its resulting body has been affected by the agency of her voice. As well as the agency from my classmate’s voice, Marta,  and the conjunction of the voices that were built in our joint tutoring meetings. The resultant of the thesis is constructed, self-organised and becomes a new material based on the entanglement of bibliographical research, voices, theoretical framework and assemblages. Reflecting on the theme of the ‘voices without organs’ as the conjunction of all of them, I built a new material that is a website in which now the thesis lives, an in-coded matter that lives in the cloud.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Interviewee: Didier Cournelle</div><br>

<b>Sophia de Jong:</b> What are the methods that you consider for a longer and healthier life? Because I read the things in your website and there was no specification. You talk about technology and the global good for society, but can you please briefly let me know what you study or what you know about the topic?<br><br>

<b>Didier Cournelle:</b> Interesting that you say that is not clear on the website because it’s something that I’m going to ask somebody that will work for the organisation. Answering your question completely I will try to make it short as possible, and I will only speak about longevity because it is the main thing I’m following. Concerning longevity, the first thing I want to say is that at the moment there are no drugs, products or therapies that are able or make possible for people to live much longer and healthier lives, otherwise it could be great but it’s not the case. There are many people and organisations saying that they found a solution but there’s nothing more than what your grandmother said to you like “don’t smoke, don’t eat this, exercise but don’t go too far” and so on. There are drugs that maybe make it possible to have a little bit longer and healthier life like Metformin, probably the number one, Rapamycin the second one. But even with these products they’re not really sure it’s working because there's not enough studies for this. So not enough studies on humans and not enough studies even on mice. You probably know the mice is the animal that many people use to try to make studies and going further than that one very important thing is that the average lifespan is rising for people all around the world, but the maximal lifespan is not rising. So the first person to reach the age of 100 years was very probably Terencia, the wife of Cicerón and she died when she was 103 years old about more than 2000 years ago. And the oldest person at the moment is a Japanese woman. She's 119 years old and she became the second oldest person ever but it’s still three years less than Jeanne Calment who died 25 years ago and lived till he was 122 years old. I wasn’t directly answering your question but I was giving you a brief introduction. I think that the most hopeful aspect at the moment is related to gene therapies related to rejuvenation of cells and there are quite a few scientists that are trying to progress in this direction but, once again, nothing yet available at the moment. There are organisations that have this goal to go further for healthier longevity like Altos Labs, Google (). Two big companies that have a lot of money to progress for longevity but no big results yet and there’s no public organisation in the world who has officially as a goal fight against diseases of old age or that make people live longer.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> You said this company is from Google?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yes, it’s coming from Google. They are already working for I think more than seven years and there’s still no big progress. Altos Labs is something very new, they work specially in the rejuvenation of cells and they are starting with big names in the genetic field and I hope it would be useful<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> It’s so interesting that actually the company that has more information about people is working on the genetic engineering and big data field.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> So you speak about big data and it is one important aspect concerning longevity but it will not be enough. Even if we know everything about whole research there’s still this absolute limit of 120 years and to go further we will need to change some really important aspects of the way that we are working. So it can be gene therapy, cell rejuvenation or it could be something else but with big data it will not be enough in my opinion. And I would like to say that at the moment if you give even ten million dollars to the best scientist in the field of longevity and you also give them hundred miles or hundred labs they will not be able to make rats or mice live longer four or five years. And if you give the same amount of money to humans it will be the same, but they will not be able to live longer than 100 years. For humans the best thing is to be a woman, like you, but even in the perfect conditions, more than 100 years is not possible. Almost not possible, a little bit more for women than men but just a difference of a few years.<br><br> 

<b>SdJ:</b> Do you know why it stops at one point? Why did people before have such a short lifespan and now we can see people alive in their 120 years of age? What happened in the middle?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> It was indeed about three or four centuries ago that it was only 30 or 40 years of age but the maximal lifespan is not rising. People were dying even before they reached adulthood, that was one big part and for people that were reaching adulthood a big part was dying of diseases not related to old age like plagues, pandemic infection diseases and violence and so on. Even three or four hundred years ago one part of the population was reaching old age and for these people when they arrive to, let’s say, 60 or 70 their life expectancy when they were reaching that age was already 10 to 20 years. Now it is 20 to 30 years, so it’s better but not much better. So we can say that life expectancy is still rising and continuous but the maximal life expectancy is almost not rising. And this is important to know also, there were people trying to fly in the beginning of the 20th century very hard till it was a success in 1903. From 1903, the first thing heavier than air was in 1920, the first commercial plane.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> So your work is about trying to make technology accessible for the people, the world and how to make longevity accessible for everyone. So I’m thinking about xenotransplantation because we’re talking about data here in a way so if we think about it. If the body becomes a quantifiable and assemblage thing, like there are things that you can add or subtract, what do you think from the longevity point of view about this body that can be interchangeable. For example, in 50 years you can have a body or a liver and then you can change it, and then you have a  bad heart and you can change it, and then all of your insides are changed. What do you think about this from the longevity point of view?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Do you know about the Ship of Theseus? You know, it is a philosophical concept. Actually, your body is changing all the time and your body. Actually, your body, I don’t know how old you are but not so old<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> I’m 29.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> 29, Ok. Except for the cells from your brain, they are different from when you were 15. Of course, they were different from when you were a child but even for a young adult almost everything changed. There’s also this expression “we never swim at the same rhythm; everything is changing all the time”. So that’s the first thing. Things are not changing because we are in continuity. Even if you go to sleep, the next day you are not the same person. Another example is when you have an operation: you disappear and you then come back. I had a serious operation which lasted five hours and for me it was one second. The fact that we have xenotransplantation is not changing a lot of the human in itself. It's not making us something else. Concerning transplantation in general there are people that are saying that the fact that we have transplants that are related to heart and soul, that changed you psychologically, but I’m not convinced. For me xenotransplantation, you already know, with the transplant of the pig<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> David Bennet <br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah, he died after two months but still it’s very promising. Almost incredible that they could save this guy for only two months. There was already a very similar operation many years ago with the heart of a baboon, but the baby is more flexible.<br><br>

For me this is very promising cause gene therapy is the future and changing genes of animals for transplantation also. But this has not been used yet related to aging. Of course, aging is a phenomenon. Well, when we die of diseases related to age. There are three categories. One is cancer, and that is related to genes. We are progressing in a country like France, mortality related to cancers is decreasing for the same category of age about one percent each year. Then you have cardiovascular diseases, that also we are progressing even faster as in the last thirty years mortality at the same level of age has decreased by fifteen percent but after that we have neurodegenerative diseases but in that area I would say that there’s no big progress. And transplantation of a brain would be a thing of tomorrow. For the anecdote I will say that there’s this kind of crazy scientist talking about head transplant. It would be more body transplant but even if you do that, it doesn’t make you stop aging. <br><br>

Anyway, this is very promising because I think that gene therapies are the future. And here you were changing the genes of animals so efficiently that it was possible to have transplantation. So it's very promising, yeah, but it's not yet to be used against aging because of course aging is a multiple aspect phenomenon and most well, when we die of diseases related to old age, we die of diseases. Well, there are three categories. One is cancer. Okay. And there, cancer is related to genes. And we are progressing in a country like France. Mortality related to cancers is decreasing for the same category of about 1% each year, then you have cardiovascular diseases there also, we are progressing even faster. The last 30 years, the mortality at the same level of age was decreasing by 50%. But after that we have neurodegenerative diseases. And there is, I would not, I will not say no progress, but no big progress and transplantation of a brain that's not for tomorrow. And that would be kind of, yeah. For the anecdote, I would say there is one kind of crazy, well, in my opinion, kind of crazy scientist speaking about head transplant, you know, actually it would be the other way around, it would be more body transplant, but okay. Even if you had a full body transplant, it doesn't make your brain not aging. So maybe it would make your brain aging less fast, but okay. Anyway, we are, we are not even close from a head or full body transplant. Not, not even, we are miles away from that.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah.

<b>DC:</b> So, coming back to, so there's this one big limit is what I said about this maximum life one. Yeah. And one other big limit is what I know I'm not saying about neuro diseases, but maybe<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> You said Neuro? What did you say? Last word, sorry, neuro?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Neuro degenerative diseases, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson. Well, the first one is Alzheimer’s.<br><br> 

<b>SdJ:</b> Perfect.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Public institutions are more active in these fields, but not progressing so much. Probably the only one working on this is Elon Musk with Neuralink.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> So, this is another question, but it's kind of the same that we were already talking about. So what does the overwhelmingly new genetically engineered technologies that are being produced mean for society and the meaning of the human body?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Once again, because there is, there is again, one word that I didn't get. Okay.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> What does the overwhelmingly new genetically engineering technologies that are being produced mean for society and the human body?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Oh, yeah. Well, I was, yeah, I was indeed speaking about gene therapies. But I don't think that there are, you mean what's, what's already available now? Nothing. I would say nothing. I mean yeah. You know I, once again, I'm only speaking about longevity, but I think yeah, I'm only speaking about longevity because gene therapies and things you have things some things were spectacularly good concerning sight, for example, but that's you can use gene therapy to, to make people think again, [inaudible] again. Okay. And the fact that you are seeing less good is related to aging in many cases. Okay. But you cannot stop aging with that. So, concerning stopping aging, there is nothing more than what we are, we are discussing already.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> I mean, similar transplantation, the only thing is like, is stopping or kind of cutting stopping disease. You know, that is kind of actually<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> But we were speaking about that. Yeah. Yeah.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Okay.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Nothing more as far as I know, as yeah. And you are not asking that, but I want to say that's one big problem concerning longevity at the moment. So to test, if a therapy is working, you have two categories, you are trying on humans, or you are trying on mice and rats. Concerning mice and rats, one of the big problems is you have quite often big articles saying, oh, we found some something. But actually in the most cases,<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> It's not like going to work at a human size.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Sorry. That is just on mice, and it will not work in human size. No.  But even then, when they test on mice and rats, very often, they just test a product or something, and then they kill the mice or the rats. So they don't even check if the rats and the mice are living longer.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Hmm. That's interesting.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> But that's, yeah, that's depressing in my opinion. And probably there are many reasons, but one of the reasons is it's cheaper, you know? But also, well, but also, I, I cannot understand because the, the, the final goal is to make people live longer. So if you don't check out mice, for example, there´s nonsense<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Has totally no sense because you don't know, like the long term.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah. Precisely I don't, I don't get that. For example, there are tests on blood, you know blood is supposed to age. And they are rich people who pay to have their blood renewed or something like that, but they don't pay to test on mice. You know, if I was very rich and wanted to live longer, I would at least ask to do at the same time a test on mice, you know, to know if it is working.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Because, and also because mice, they don't have long lives. So, if you take old mice, 18 months old, you know about the results in less than two years.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Wow. So it's ridiculous they actually didn't, you know, follow up. <br><br>

<b>DC:</b> I don't, so I don't understand why more people are not doing that, but again okay. Then that, that was about mice and rats and after that you have humans and for humans, there are many, many rules making it very difficult to test even for people who are volunteers informed, you know, like I can say that I'm kind of a volunteer informed and so on, but if I decide to, to test something, it's kind of, well, not kind of, it's prohibited [inaudible] because of so many rules. So like that yeah, but I want to protect you against yourself, you know, like, but okay. If I want to, okay. If I go to the supermarket and I buy cigarettes and alcohol, I can binge drinking. Okay. But if I want to take some well informed risk by taking Metformin it's not allowed. And even let's say, if it is allowed for me, it's not allowed for the scientist because the, the, the publishers will refuse to publish the article because it's not respecting laws. And like I say, always joking, but it's not a joke if I'm sitting in the street and I'm taking a look at the people going on. Okay. It's okay. Nothing against the law, if I'm taking a look at the people who are getting old during a few months and I don't ask their consent, I'm making something illegal. You know, what's totally crazy for me, even if I'm just thinking a look at them at these people, you know, even if I, I don't ask, I mean even if I'm just taking a look at these people and they don't know about it, you know, so for me, that's a, a strange world and concerning this because you spoke about big data, and so on I advise you to take a look at this text from, do you know probably you don't know Stephan So and so<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> No<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> No. Stephan So and so, I give you the first name.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah. Because like, I remember I, I saw an interview from you like a talk, sorry. That it was about longevity, artificial<br><br> intelligence and health data right, I don't know if you remember.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah. Yes. But I wasn't probably speaking about this guy yet, because the article I will show is quite recent. So here, I give you the title. That's one. So then maybe she's from, I don't know, maybe you, you're from Argentina,<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Argentinian Dutch, yeah<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah. And so you speak Spanish, of course. Yeah. But I think that she's Spanish speaking this woman, but I'm not sure, not so important. Anyway, what I need is the link. Where is the link? Okay. Google is your friend. I will Google this file. Okay. Okay. Or it's a link. You have to go to the link, but it's okay. Now disclaimer, I probably don't agree with everything that this guy is saying, but I have to go further to understand, because he's kind of a provocative person that if you to summarize in, well, to summarize what I understand about this, his text is we should not care about privacy. We should only care about using data for health and about freedom of doing what we want, but privacy sorry, the right to privacy is not the important thing because, you know actually there's this idea at the moment, the privacy is very important, but like if you take a look at the situation just a few, 10 years ago, or 20 years ago, maybe when you were, for example, let's say the right for people to have sex with other people and so on is the important thing. It Is not the right to privacy. The important thing is the right to have sex or to have to get married to it, you know, and this, this is a change in the perception. So 20 years ago, if you wanted to get married, you had to, let's say, declare it officially. Yeah. But nobody was thinking, oh, this is against privacy. You know, the fact that marriage was a public and still kind of a public event. So there's no, you, you, at the, I think at the moment it's still a public event, and it's still, but probably in a few years  private you know. Yeah. Okay. And for me, there's a, there is a kind of let's say not logical changing things in the way that people understand. And one, people consider the right to privacy and one of the biggest consequences is the fact that people don't want to share their data and especially the health data, because they consider this like being against privacy.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Wow, this is true. Like we're gonna get some new ethical questions and<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> And stuff like this.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> And also, you know, this idea of how I can say that the fact that people don't want to share the health data is kind of a paradox against solidarity. Yeah. And in Belgium. Well, but that's more, that's also, so we were speaking about transplantation. So there is also the, the classical transportation is from my body to your body if I die. Okay. [inaudible] Because I'm too old, but okay. Anyway, in Belgium, theoretically if I die, I don't have to give my authorization for people to use my body.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> They will just use it.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> They can, the doctors can use it without my authorization, but particularly it's not that way. And I heard that it was the same in Spain. I dunno, Argentina, it is kind of strange, you know,<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> You can choose. Actually, I don't remember in Argentina,<br><br>
<b>DC:</b> The big question is this one opting it's called like this opting in versus opting out.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Hmm.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> In theory, it's quite the same. So, opting in this you say, I want to be able to share and opting out is saying, I don't want to share. So normally it's the same, but particularly if you have an opting system, most people will not ask. And if you have an opting out system so if you have an opting in system particularly most people will not share<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Hmm, it's funny. Right. And it's also funny that for example, like health data is also used for, to know, make probabilities and know how like other bodies are,<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Again, one word that, that in the get for example<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> That's actually health data that would help everybody.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yes, yes, yes.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> You know? <br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah. And it's not working and with the COVID it was of course, very, very, well for me, there is, there are all problems related to privacy, but also there are all problems related to Parkinson’s and, and sometimes there are patents. Do you understand them? Yeah. Patents. Yeah. sometimes they are kind of related people don't want to share their health data because they don't want to give to a big company<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Well, that's actually as well. <br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah, yeah. I can understand. But on the other side,<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> If we don't have it like,<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Well, I don't okay. Let's say, let's imagine, let's imagine that, yeah. Google or apple or yeah, big pharma is using my health data without let's say without any consequences for me they will win more money. And even, even if it is not positive for the, for the other people, I don't care so much, you know, but okay. But the most, but the most important thing is that it's useful for other people. And the big, one of the big problems is in the system at the moment. Because there are so many private companies, it's almost impossible to share without also giving money to big companies in a way. You understand what I mean? So yeah. You share your health data, if you say, and they<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Make money out of you<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> It's also for big companies and, and even more problem is sometimes big companies will take it and say, oh, it's for us only, you know, so they will share, they use it and they take it for themself and not share any data. But yeah. So, so for me so for me, my solution would be health data is a common public good that you cannot own. Yeah. And that all that private companies can also not own.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Everyone else is for everyone. Public source, open source.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yes. Open source] but not a good word because open source is more for software for, but okay. Yeah. Open<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Sorry I have gone into programming. So,<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah.<br><br>
<b>SdJ:</b> So, but other question related to you know, longevity in itself, like, what do you think about like the overwhelming, like, if we all, for example, I know like you are, you are promoting that, you know, if, if someone wants to leave, they can leave, but if they don't, they don't. Right. So it's up to you. If you wanna have , live a longer life. But what it would mean for like, you know, having so much old people in general, like how do<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> We, well, for me, okay. So, when we speak about old people, we speak about people who have lived longer and who are in decline in health. But the goal of longevity is not to make people live longer. And decreasing health, the goal is to make people live longer. So people would be let's say, would live longer, but would not be older that's older in the say in the, in the sense of yeah, in less good state as before. Well, of course, well, not of course. Well, okay. No, let's see, of course if there are relatively important improvements, but not enough to make, to stop aging, it'll be kind of a process, you know, but, but people who are against fight aging, they, they very often say, oh yes, but people are living longer, but in worse health, but that's not true. There was recently one study of that, it's called a kind of global burden. There was a big study. And in short they say for each three or four years, no, for each four or five years of longevity, more, you have three or four years in good health. So when the life expectancy, let's say when the life expectancy is rising with five years, you have four years in good health and one year in bad health. But of course, it's not like it's, it's more complicated and in my feeling I mean, we probably win more healthy years than even then. Let's say people before they had probably, let's say 60 years in good health and 10 years in bad health, no, it's more like, 62 years in good health and eight years in, in bad health. So it's improving except for neurodegenerative diseases.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Hmm.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> The progress is really bad health mostly. And this progress, because we don't progress concerning let's say, fighting disease and because we progress concerning all other aspects, caring for old people in what's the name in English, retiring houses yeah. You know all these things. Hmm. But for example, one symbol of old people is, I dunno how you call that, people who are like that, you don't see so many people like that who cannot work and so on. Yeah. you see less than that.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> So why do you think that there's no, so much research made on neuro degenerative disorders?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> No, it's not that there is not much research, it’s that we don't progress.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Oh, we don't progress.<br><br>
<b>DC:</b> Yeah. Yeah. There is a lot of research, but we don't progress. And so why don't we don't progress? That's,<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> The big question.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> If you have an answer, I'm ready to give you all my money tomorrow, but I mean yeah. Why but it's kind of fascinating, depressing, because since probably 20 years or something like that, sometimes there are new things, new drugs that seem to give good results on mice and they have good models. Okay. And after that, they test on the human cells all great. And then they test on humans. Nothing, almost nothing.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> So, we, well, it would be a long story, but the short story is we don't progress actually. There are less when you take a look at the number of people having Alzheimer disease at the same age it's decreasing, but it's probably only decreasing because people smoke less,  have better homes, not because we have products. So once again, here, the same, like I said, you give $2 billion to the best specialist of neurological diseases, you take 20 people with mild, maybe not mild, but okay. Already advance on one side and 20 other people on the other side. And you said, okay, $2 billion for these people. There will be no big difference between the two groups. They will probably die more or less at the same time and be in bad health and so on. Yeah.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Okay. I, this is so interesting. Then I, I have another question, but this has to do with kind of like the thing that you just talk about, the mice, and then how we kill them. But I didn't know actually about this, and now I'm very surprised, but relating this in a way to a kind of single transplantation. So, I was thinking about what is the significance? Oh, what significance does the interaction or relationship between humans and animals have with these technological advances?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah.<br><br>
 
<b>SdJ:</b> So, what significance does the interaction between humans and animals have in bio technological advances because before animals helped us to, you know, they were for company and now we are using them for, for biological, for, for technology. So we're actually making animal technology right. In a way.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> So,<br><br>

CD: And what, what do I think about that?<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah, so it, like, is it like that are, are we actually making animals technology now in a way, are this animals technology?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Let me think. No, no, not, not. We are using technology to transform these animals and to make it possible to study them for longevity, for humans, but they are not, I would say not more technology that like if you make an experiment on water, I dunno, water is not technology. But after that, of course there are many let's say questions with the use of animals and to say a few words about that I always say, yeah, when, when you test on animals to make them live longer, you test actually something you can quite good for them, but I said this problem that they, at the moment, they sacrifice the animals at the end, so, okay. But that's the first thing I want to say. The second thing I want to say about this ethical aspect is if I had to, if I was a mouse, and I had to choose between life in the world and life in the lab, I would probably choose life in the lab because my life expectancy would be at least for a long life experiment. Well, I would die. I would die probably shorter than normal anyway, but longer than animals in the world. Hmm. After that also for rats and mice it's a strange situation that we care so much more about what's better for them, than when we use poison to kill them in our streets or yeah. Yeah. Where we don't. Yeah. That's yeah. So that's it.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Okay. Thank you for your opinion. And I think I kind of spoke almost everything I wanted to know about this, but is there anything else that you actually think is important for me to know about, you know, comes to your mind to be related to my topic?<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> I will, sorry, I will read again, you precise to your first email to see if I have something we didn't speak about all  let's say social and moral aspects. Why is it good to live longer and healthier?  So, you can find on the newsletters that are online still in one. Yeah. Still in one, in a few sentences.  For me, it's very clear that living longer and healthcare is positive in many aspects and is positive for people individually. Well, because we have more time to love each other. We have more time to discover things. We have more time for empathy and so on but it's also good for society in general because when people live longer, they are more careful with each other. They are more careful with the environment and maybe even more important because they are less violent people who live longer and technological progress can be dangerous, has many dangers. And if we had, we use technological progress with a priority of residents´ longevity in general, but longevity specifically, but also residents in general  the risk  for us are less important than other technological progress. I will not say that there are no risks, but more hope and especially using artificial intelligence for this is better than using artificial intelligence for well, of course, yeah, I would say, but also that using artificial intelligence for let's say things who are not related directly related to our resilience once again, because artificial intelligence can be a danger, especially if we don't have human goals. Okay. Sometimes people say, yeah, they want progress, any progress. They think that everything will be beautiful in the end. Elon Musk is one of them. I'm not a fan of Elon Musk, but one of the things that people don't understand about Elon Musk is that he thinks that technological progress is very positive, but also very dangerous. Yeah, of course. So in the same way, I say very often today is the best day of the history of humanity, but today is also the most dangerous day of the history of humanity, but both things together. So that was, that was what I wanted to say. And now I'm taking a look at your first email, just to see if I forgot something interview questions, yeah, yeah. Internal quantified self, sorry. But we spoke about that. Yeah. We asked so much about bio, do it yourself and so on, but yeah, I don't have so much to say about this for me, I like doing everything by myself for longevity. Like you understood for the rest I don't care. Well, I don't care. It's easier. Well, okay.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Do you, do you personally use any, anything, or like for yourself, for longevity or<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Not? Not really, I, so two and a half years ago, I had, and half heart in fact with five bypasses. So and since then I take Metformin, but, and I mean yeah, I take Metformin. That is supposed to be the best for longevity that thinks that already exists, but I would take Metformin anyway. So no, once again, there is nothing at the moment. What I'm doing for longevity is to try to yeah. To push for longevity for everybody. So, and me also and 1, 2, 3, 4 days ago, I turned 60 years. And so it's difficult.<br><br>
<b>SdJ:</b> Happy birthday<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. Yes. But, okay. So, nothing if there was something if there was something where the consensus would be, it seems to be very promising, but their dangers would probably do it. But also with being careful to share my data, you know?<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Hmm.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> That, that it's not only useful for me or that if it is not working that all people know it<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Also, not working. Yeah. Cause,<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Cause at the moment we don't share enough health data and especially when there are non-working clinical tests, it's less published. So it's even more interesting, more important when something is not working to share it than when something is working, when something is working, somebody will know probably when something is not working. Well of course, so if I'm testing something and it's not working, I'm not very CA, I will not have directly the tendency to share the information or I was not unsuccessful, but it's important because for other people they will not try the same. So very important, like and there is one website I, well, there are people who push to share results of all critical trials on humans. And I think it's very important.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Hmm. Yeah. Just like this idea of a technical and technological progress system, but for everyone.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> Yeah. And also, yeah, this idea that there is one risk and also things that don't work. And it's important to know about these two aspects.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Hmm.<br><br>

<b>DC:</b> So, thank you for these questions.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Thank you so much for your time.<br><br>

<div class="subsubtitles">Metahumanist views on xenotransplantation</div><br>

<b>Sophia de Jong:</b> What do you think about xenotransplantation?<br><br>
 
<b>Jaime del Val:</b> First of all let me clarify that I am not specialised in this field, but I will venture some general considerations in trying to shed some light on what I see as wrong and misleading questions and debates being raised around this and other related issues. <br><br>
 
Some time ago I might have felt sympathetic towards xenotransplantation as experimental way of overcoming limited conceptions of the human, but I have developed increasing awareness of the radical animal abuses and the planetary scale problems, actually leading us to extinction, on which many, perhaps unquestioned aspects of xenotransplantation are grounded.<br><br>
 
First of all comes animal abuse. From my metahumanist perspective breeding and killing animals for xenotransplantation is (at least) as unacceptable and criminal as breeding and killing humans for xenotransplantation. This is crucial because it seems to me that at the very core of xenotransplantation, its industry, and the deep assumptions underlying it, is the idea that, since we cannot breed and kill humans for getting organs, let’s do that with animals.<br><br>
 
I could try to imagine a future in which trans-species families of humans and non-humans are a more established fact and all animal abuse is abolished (with a much lower human population)... and could imagine the possibility of having xenotraplantation from our trans-species kinship when they naturally or accidentally die, just as is done with humans, as what could be perhaps the only acceptable option. Then xenotransplantation could help further undoing the specist gap... but this is of course far from what happens today. We can never undo specist divides via xenotransplantation if the technology is grounded on animal breeding, slavery and killing!<br><br>

On the other hand healthcare conceptions are also grounded on an elitist human supremacy, are also highly problematic and need to be redefined. We take for granted that individual human lives (mainly of the rich eurowhite/angloamerican) need to be extended as much as possible at all costs and this is a huge problem, building upon an implicit eugenics that ignores the fact that this suprematism is grounded on a massive planetary killing and slavery that paradoxically drives us to extinction.<br><br>
 
Currently dominant Healthcare systems mostly ignore the structural cause of most human pathologies (physical, mental and emotional) that I suggest are in the atrophied, aligned and toxic ways of living that we have created ourselves, and have been emerging since the origins of agriculture. It is agreed upon by most scholars that agriculture radically impoverished the way of living that gatherer cultures had had throughout hundreds of thousands of years. It also brought about a delirious overpopulation. This toxic civilization that has established itself against the flows of the earth has created a mass extinction. Every single aspect linked to so called technical progress is creating the extinction which exposes the radical inferiority of technologies that determine... (and the superiority of weeds... in the most insignificant of weeds in my garden there is more intelligence than in all our books, human rationality and AI labs put together...)<br><br>
 
On the other hand we also need to deconstruct what these very normative systems have wrongly pathologised and that can be claimed as mere diversity.<br><br>
 
Lastly, illness and death is part of our openness as symbiogenetic bodies that are part of a much larger planetary scale field of evolutionary, neverending variation whose core aspect is indeterminacy. It is this indeterminacy that “civilization” is at war with, as a result we are paralyzing evolution with the cosmic idiocy of “intelligent design”, trying to determine nature.<br><br>
 
What we need instead is a new ethics of radical care, of bodies propriocepting and co-sensing each other, with shorter and richer lives, accepting death and illness, while undoing the systemic sources for most our illnesses that are also radically damaging Planetary Health!<br><br> 
 
Once we analyse all of these assumptions I think there is little room left to defend the xenotransplantation, at least as promoted today, the animal abuse it is grounded upon, the set of human supremacy beliefs, the costly technologies...<br><br>
 
Instead of extending human lives by killing all other life forms and the planet (which is a species suicide) we should put all our efforts in STOPPING TO BE THE PLAGUE!<br><br>
 
Caring for nonhumans is not just a question of compassion, but a core evolutionary responsibility!  Without biodiversity there is no evolution. For most of its existence the Sapiens was one of the 8 million species, contributing to biodiversity, but over the past millennia we are creating a Holocide, a Planetary Holocaust in which all humanity is Nazi (as Jewish Noble prize winning writer Isaac Bashevis Singer said) imbued with human supremacy, a devastation so huge that it is a species suicide and threatens the possibility even of future life on Earth without humans: the worst possible cosmic crime and idiocy.<br><br>
 
 
<b>SdJ:</b> What kind of body conceptions or configurations become from xenotransplanted humans?<br><br>
 
<b>JdV:</b> I think in some posthumanist circles too much fuss is made about the chimeric posthuman hybrids that become from xenotransplantation, or from the cyborg trope, and this is because we are still too burdened by humanistic ideas: we still believe too much in the existence of a human species! But the concept itself of the human is a radical ontological chimera! What we need to do is to hack the human as ontological chimera, and the notion of species, both of which have merged as part of the programme of Human Supremacy that drive us and the planet to extinction, as it is a system of massive domination, slavery and killing that is annihilating the entire planetary environment, only comparable to and perhaps worse than previous mass extinctions.<br><br>
 
From the point of view of Symbiogenesis theory as elaborated by Margulis, all of evolution is a question of symbiosis: species are first of all processes of ongoing mutation or variation, and are defined by their relations, to other species and to the environments: these relations are ontogenetic/symbiogenetic or in Barad’s terms intra-active: all species co-emerge in their ongoing relational variation together with the entire ecosystems of the biosphere: this has been the case for 4 billion years!... until the human has tried to impose on the planet and all its life forms the cosmic idiocy of top down design!...<br><br> 
 
There are also many humanities and all of them in variation and relation. The dominant human that is killing the earth is the one that has tried to split itself by defining a set of dogmas that are actually those creating a mass extinction. <br><br>
 
The fact that we can take in organs from other species is part of our symbiogenetic nature, heritage and evolution, the fact that some xenotransplantations don’t work is not ultimately different from the fact that some human transplantations don’t work either.<br><br>
 
But what we need to question is the set of human supremacy assumptions underlying xenotransplantation. This is the purpose of my ontological therapies!<br><br>
 
<b>SdJ:</b> What significance does the relationship between human and non-human animals have in biotechnological advances? And how has it evolved/changed in recent years?<br><br>
 
<b>JdV:</b>As said, I think xenotransplantation is deeply rooted in human supremacy, which is getting worse, where animals are abused in experimentation in ways that should be utterly criminalised. What needs to get stopped is in the Animal Holocaust, instead of perpetuating domination beliefs that drive us to extinction.<br><br>
 
At the same time animal liberation movements advance in some places, for instance by recognising the animal as sentient beings, this I am proposing to use in legal battles against all animal abuse, for an unprecedented metahuman revolution.<br><br>
  
<b>SdJ:</b> Are pigs bred for xenotransplantation technology?<br><br>
 
<b>JdV:</b> Of course pigs and so many other animals are massively bred, enslaved and killed in concentration camps euphemistcally called farms, in unimaginable numbers of around 100 billion per year, for all sorts of purposes...now including xenotransplantation.<br><br>
 
<b>SdJ:</b> What can you tell me about planetary health as conditions for proliferation of biodiversity and metaspecies futures?<br><br>
 
<b>JdV:</b> It is the reverse: BIODIVERSITY is the condition for planetary health....and this is what we are killing with the monotechnical stupidity of deterministic human supremacy domination dogmas.<br><br>
 
<b>SdJ:</b> What does meta-humanities mean?<br><br>
 
<b>JdV:</b> It implies ontohacking the ontological chimera of the human, embracing our symbiogenetic nature and its indeterminate variation, undoing human supremacy and its devastation, stopping the planetary Holocasut and its extinction cycle, embracing the multiplicity of humanities as relations to other species, becoming once more on of the 8 million species of the biosphere, contributing to biodiversity instead of killing it... It implies undoing the millennia old atrophy and paralysis on which this process is grounded an regaining a lost capacity to sense and move in variation, not for going back but for unprecedented variations.<br><br>
 
<b>SdJ:</b> How to revert the currently dominant ‘Trash-human Unhacenment’ into a metahuman flourishing?<br><br>
 
<b>JdV:</b> By undoing human supremacy and the sensorimotor poverty on which it is grounded, disaligning from millennia of alignments, by relearning to move and sense, overcoming the fearful self-obsessed, atrophied creature that we have become, and its being dominated by  a reductive rational intelligences that imposes on the world its verbal-numeric abstractions, and embracing symbiotic mutations once again, by broadening our sensitivity and regaining lost proprioception.<br><br>
 
<b>SdJ:</b> What do you think big data and health care have to do with the construction of body intelligence in the age of algorithms?<br><br> 
 
<b>JdV:</b> Big data culture and current health care systems in rich countries are further step in annihiliating BI, by making us more and more dependent on algorithmic, pharmaceutical, and other technical systems that are actually at the core or our discomforts and killing the planet, increasing the dystopian society emerging over millennia since the birth of agriculture, and making us more and more atrophied and incapable of listening to the body, of varying our movement and senses, of relating to the world and its indeterminacy... they are part of the extinction system.<br><br>
 
We need to learn from non humans.<br><br>

<div class="subtitles">Interviewee: Benjamin Smith</div><br><br>


<b>Sophia de Jong:</b> So first of all, I would like to ask you, how did you actually become interested in xenotransplantation because you were previously working with heart transplantation, right? Cardiovascular?<br><br>

<b>Benjamin Smith:</b> Yeah, I'm from London, England, and I trained in cardiac surgery in Britain. And then, I was very interested in research at the same time. So I took three years off to do a PhD in the preservation of the heart for transplantation. This was a long time ago in the late 1960s and early seventies. And when I finished my training, I wanted to try to stay in transplantation, which was still just developing at that time. And I went to work with a surgeon Chris Barnard, who lived in Cape Town, who did the first-ever heart transplant on a patient back in 1967. And I went to work with him primarily to do research, but in fact, he wanted me to look after the transplant patients as well. So I spent seven years there. And during that time I realized that the biggest problem we had was getting donor organs. We had patients waiting for weeks and weeks and weeks and then dying without a transplant. Yeah. And so I began to look and see what other organs, what other sources of organs we could have. And I was doing quite a lot of work in the research laboratory there, and we had access to baboons because they were caught by the farmers in the area. And they were either shocked or were brought into the main facility. And so we could get baboons, very inexpensively. So we used baboons as our experimental animal model. And a huge advantage because a baboon's immune system is very similar to humans, much more so than say dogs and so on and so I was doing quite a bit of work in the lab. And then when I decided that the big problem was the source of organs, I started to investigate the pig as a potential organ donor for a number of logistical reasons. First of all, we've been living with pigs for hundreds of years, and we've been using the process of possibilities. We haven't picked up any serious infections from pigs even though we've been very close to them, we've used them for food. We now use them for heart valves. We use them for experimental models, all sorts of things. And so I first thought of course, of using non-human primates as the sources of organs, but they have in short supply themselves particularly if they're larger animals, there'd be a lot of ethical backlashes if we were slaughtering hundreds of chimpanzees and so on. And secondly, it takes a baboon, for example, nine years to reach adult size. And even then it's only about 40 kilograms. Whereas many humans of course are a lot bigger than that. So it would be very restrictive in the number of the size of the organs and the breeding of the baboons they breed in ones or twos, whereas pigs breed in tens or twelves at a time. So you could get a herd of pigs very rapidly, whereas if you can't get a herd of the boots very rapidly. So I switched from non-primates, which from an immunological point of view, are much closer to humans. And so the barrier between the two is much weaker. But I switched to looking at pigs. And since then, my main research project has been xenotransplantation. Initially, I was particularly interested obviously in hearts, but in more recent years, I've become interested in other aspects, particularly the kidney eyelets for patients who are diabetic would get a pig, eyelid transplant, cause eyelids produce the insulin that they need. We've looked at red blood cells as a source from pigs rather than humans. And there are a number of other areas that we've been investigating. So that's how I got involved in xenotransplantation. And I don't do any clinical work now. I haven't done it for some time, but I did do heart transplants in humans for 17 years before I switched entirely to research.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Okay. So you mostly do research, like, you know, you don't do trials or?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Yeah. What we do is we'd be working with companies who are making the pigs. We don't make the pigs but we test them by transplanting a heart or a kidney from the pig into a monkey or a baboon. And we tell them whether it's working or not and how long it survives. And then we go back to them from our lab studies and suggest what other things they could do to the pig to make it more, to improve as a universal donor for humans. And that's been, we've been doing that for 30 years. It's taken a long time to get to where we are now, where we have pigs with 10 genetic manipulations all geared to protect the pig organ from the human immune response, the human immune response against the human organ takes about seven days to actually reject it. Even if you gave no expression, but against the pig organ, it takes about five minutes to reject. It's very rapid. And so we've got a big barrier to overcome. The fact we're now getting out to months or years is a big achievement, but of course, it's taken a long time to do that.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Of course. I was also going to ask you like why are you not using baboons instead of pigs. You already also told me that you actually know these transgenic pigs are manufactured by others, with other companies and you just test them out.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> We work very closely with the company. We make a lot of input about what we think from our studies or from, you know, what we know about the field, which direction they should go in and then they try to do it. And then we test that and then we go back to something else and so on. But a lot of our work actually, majority of our work is actually in the lab with human serum, human blood and pig cells, because you could tell a lot just from that, if the human serum kills the cells in the lab, you know that the human serum's going to kill the pig organ so that we, there's no point in making a pig with that particular modification. But if the serum doesn't kill the cells and the cells look fine, then we could go back to them and say, this is probably worth doing so I would say the majority of our work is in simple cell serum. Serum cell combination, because the genetic engineering of the pig and the testing in baboons course is very expensive and time-consuming so the more we can save them spending that money and time the better.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> So now I know what happens before you test these pigs, but then what happens after, right? What happens with the animals?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> There are two aspects to it with most humans. If you're going to put a human organ the response is through cells in the body that attack the organ. That's why they take a week to actually kill them off because the cells have to multiply and attack the organ. That's the main form of rejection. With the pig the main form of rejection are antibodies that we already have in our blood, which immediately destroy the pig organ. Now, why do we have anti pig antibodies in our blood? Well, it's because when we are infants, our gut gets colonized by various viruses and bacteria. And so just in the normal process of life living and we make antibodies against those as a sort of protection. So that those viruses and bacteria that are going to reside in our gut don't cause us any trouble but unfortunately, those viruses and bacteria express on the surface of carbohydrate molecules, which we call antigens which are identical to some of the pig cells express on the pig vascular endothelium of the blood vessels. They have the same sugars on the surface. So when we are exposed to this pig organ, and we've already got antibodies that we've primed against these bacteria, they immediately latch onto the pig organ and destroy it. And you can't get around that with the present drugs that we have available in expressive drugs, they have no effect on that. And so that's where the genetic engineer pig comes in, for example, there are three key carbohydrates that the pig organ expresses and through genetic engineering, we've knocked those out. They're no longer expressed in the pig. So there's no target now for these antibodies and the antibodies activate a process for the complement cascade, which causes the actual destruction. And we know that human complement is very bad for pig cells, but it's not bad for human cells because human cells express a human complement regulatory protein which protects them. So that when you are in your blood, if you've got some bacteria, you're going to destroy those with the compliment. It doesn't destroy your own cells at the same time. Because your own cells express these complement regulators. So we put into the pig these complement regulators, which they're human complement regulators, which protect them against human complement because pigs have pig complimentary regulators to protect against pig complement. It's not very good so we've put in about half a dozen protective genes into the pig. In addition to knocking out the main targets for antibodies, we've put in all these protective genes, and that's why we can do so well. Now, even when you put that pig organ into a boon or a human, the human will try to develop antivirals against other targets on the pig organ, so that you haven't knocked out the ones that don't cause immediate rejection, but will cause rejection if they're left there. And so that's where the inexpressive drugs come in, that we would normally give to a patient to protect patients. Organ. These are still necessary for these patients who are going to get a pig organ transplant, but we use a slightly different drug from the ones we use with humans because we found a different drug that is better for pigs than it is for humans. And the other thing about that is that I think eventually we will be able to genetically manipulate the pig that we won't need to give any drugs at all, because we'll manipulate the pig in such a way that it will be protected, not only from antibody response but also from the later response. And the more we can do to the pig, the less we have to do to the patient. And that's very important because the more you do to the patient, you express the patient, the more the patient is susceptible to infections, latency, and so on. So if we can get to the point that we don't have to do anything to the patient, that would be much better for the patient.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Work the issues externally, in the pig. So then the human would not have the immunological response, but then this comes into question, like, because you talk about since you're a child, you have the microbiology, like developing in your body, but is there any trials on babies? I guess, right. If you grab actually or put like an organ in a baby, they would have less immunological response somehow because of what?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Babies have a weaker immunological response, yes. Because they haven't developed sufficiently to have a strong response. And so babies have a lower response to both pig cells and to human cells than adults do. And that is one thing we are hoping to utilize to our benefit. For example, there are babies born with very complex congenital heart disease that they're probably not going to live more than a few days or weeks. And the idea for them is to do a heart transplant, say immediately in the first week of life, if you do that, they do very, very well. And it's probably because their immune system doesn't try to reject the organ as well as yeah because they're not developed enough. So the immune system is much more flexible and plastic. And so it accepts this news, you need some special therapy, but you don't need so much. And those patients do better than any other patients with any other organ transplant. If you look 25 years later, nearly 60% of those patients are still alive and well with the same organ, the same kidney, and the same heart. I mean, whereas if you are an adult, it's very rare to have that long without some sort of low-grade rejection going on. So we know, but the trouble is, in the United States, it takes about four to six months for a baby to get a heart from another baby. That's about the right size. And so during that time, most of these patients would die, except you can do some palliative operations, which will keep them going for a while. But our approach is that in the first week you put in a pig heart and that keeps them going even for six months. And then when you get the human heart, you replace them. And that way too, we will learn how vigorously the babies reject these pig’s hearts. We may find that we don't need very much inexpressive therapy, or we may find at six months, the pig’s heart looks fine. It's doing well. And then we'll say, well, perhaps next time we'll either pig’s heart in a bit longer. So we'll gradually get to know how long a pig will survive any human.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> So you're doing trials then?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> We're not doing trials on any babies yet. We're doing them in infants or young baboons, but not in children. We need to do, how long can we get out is six months regularly and consistently, because we don't want to, to do put the pig heart into a baby. And finally it only lasts three months. We think the longest survivor's been about eight months. So we think we'll be able to do that. The other good thing about that is it doesn't commit the baby to have a pig heart there for the rest of its life. It's only a temporary thing. And so that may be a good thing too. And I think that also would appeal to the regulatory authorities like us food and drug administration. You're not committing this baby to this pig heart forever. You're just saying it's going to be there temporary to keep it alive while do you get him a human<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Heart? So why do you think it's better to use like xenotransplantation instead of using like 3d printed as you know, organs or like biomechanical other...?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Well, biomechanical organs have progressed very, very well in the last decade. And so most adults who are waiting for a heart transplant, or even if they're not eligible for a heart transplant, could have an assist device in a mechanical assist device to assist their heart. And they do very well, at least for a couple of years. Long term results are not so good, but they're getting better all the time. But in babies, and infants, there are no assist devices or mechanical parts that you can really put in and they do very poorly in them. It's not built for babies. There are some built supposedly for children, so on, but in tiny babies, the results are very poor.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> But also just because of the size of the...?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> It's mainly just size and, you know, a mechanical thing. You've got everything would've to be small, more like to get blood clotting in them and so on. And so on with all these mechanical devices, you have to bring out a line from the chest to plug it into an electric supply. So that very much limits what you can do as a patient. You can have a portable supply, you can keep you going for a few hours, but for babies that would be really quite difficult to do. I think to pig off would be much better for babies than a mechanical heart.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Hmm. Interesting. I didn't think about it like that. So I also was going to ask you another question, like if you're actually working or researching any other technologies to cross-species like with the xenotransplantation or maybe?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> This, we are only looking at xenotransplantation, not, but not just organs we've been looking at big blood cells and so on. The alternative, of course, is apart from artificial organs, and mechanical devices. So are things like, can you make a pig organ or can you make a human organ through stem cells? You take some primitive cells from the patient and you try to manipulate 'em. So they'll develop into a whole heart or a whole kidney and people are working on that. I think it's going to take a long time to do that because you know to develop all the different cells that you've got in a kidney, it's asking a lot of it was a single type of cell, for example, as the beta cells in the eye pancreatic that make the insulin that is much more feasible. And I think that it may become possible within the next few years that you can take the patient's own cells, convert them into these beta cells, expand them and then put them back into the patient. And maybe that will help cure their diabetes. But I think a whole organ is going to take a long, long time to develop. Hmm. And there are other ways of doing regenerative medicine techniques and so on where they take cells and they try to convert them into organs or so, but I think it's going to be a long time and we are very close now to doing big heart and kidney transplants. And so I think we are looking way ahead of the other alternative approaches that could be possible.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Okay. And so how do you think xenotransplantation would change biodiversity or because you work with crossing species, right? So how do you think this would change biodiversity or the meaning of, you know, longevity or extension of human life?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> I doubt if it'll change longevity because there are so many factors involved in that. People who are going to die of heart failure or kidney failure or liver failure will get a new lease of life just as they do with a human organ transplant. The big problem with a human organ transplant is just a lack of organs. There are about 120,000 people on the waiting list in the United States. There'll be about 40,000 transplants this year. So that means 80,000 people will still wait unless they die in the meantime. And there are a lot of patients who will wait for a kidney transplant on dialysis. They may wait for eight or 10 years and still not get an organ, or get a transplant. And those patients, if you look at the details, nearly half of them will be dead or be taken off the waiting list within five years because they are no longer suitable. They no longer believe it to be suitable for a transplant. They're not there. They've got too many other problems or they've got too weak or too old or whatever it's. So those are the patients I think that you would first suggest to them that they might consider a xenotransplant if you are probably never going to get a human organ because the organ supply is so bad and you've gotta stay on dialysis. And most patients do not like being on dialysis. It takes up to three days a week of their lives. It limits them significantly, never feeling so well on dialysis as can do with a functioning organ. I think quite a few of those patients would say, well yeah, I'll try a pig kidney. If it functions for a year or two, that's wonderful. You are off dialysis and hopefully, if it doesn't function, you can go back on dialysis. And I think a lot of people would accept that approach. And eventually, just as human organ transplants have improved enormously over the years with better drugs, more experience and so on, I think pig organ transplants will expand and the results will get better and better. And eventually, everybody will have a pig organ transplant.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> How do you think this has to do with biodiversity? Because in the end, it's like genetic chimera or not because I am just trying to understand. You put the human DNA in this pig, right? Then when you put the organ back into the human, or when you put the transplanted organ in the human does it become a chimera from a genetic perspective?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Yes. and we did some surveys over the last few years asking patients and families of patients, how they thought about it, would they feel uncomfortable having a pig organ and you probably, you don't remember, but in the early days of human organ transplantation, there was a lot of patients that felt they didn't want to have somebody else's organ in them. Particularly, for example, men didn't want to have a woman's organ, they didn't want to have a woman's heart because they thought that would make them weak because they thought women would be weak. And there were all sorts of things that they didn't want to have. But when the crunch comes and you're going to die, you usually begin to change your mind about these things and think, well, if it's going to keep me alive, I'll go for it. If I had a number of patients who were never going to get a heart transplant until they'd had two cardiac arrests and been resuscitated. And then they realized they were living on a knife-edge. And then they decided that they perhaps like whatever heart transplant. Yeah. So people's attitudes change. But when we carried out these surveys in the last two or three years, we found that most patients, again, and most family patients, realize that the patient might get if children, might get bullied at school or laughed at because they've got a pig, heart, or a pig kidney or something, but they felt that if it would keep them alive and well and that's a big if at the moment, because we don't know how long it will keep them alive. And well, they felt that was worth taking that risk. And that they didn't think they would've too many psychological problems because they had a pig heart in them.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> They thought that would not be too much. The only group that was very hesitant about it were African Americans because they've in the past, they have been experimented on unethically by some of the medical profession and that's, they have that in the back of their mind, are we experimenting on them? And so they were much more cautious about saying, yes, they would have a pig heart transplant or pig kidney transplant. But that's what I say, is a historical thing just because of the situation they've been in, in the past. But for most people, they felt that if the results were going to be as good as a human heart transplant, then they would go for it. Now at the moment, we can't guarantee that because we haven't got the experience that they are going to survive as long as a patient with a human heart, probably they won't, but they might survive long enough to make it worthwhile. And remember if they begin to reject that heart, there's always another pig. We can always give another pig heart transplant, which is not the case with human hearts because there's a limit.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Of course you cannot design humans for this.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> So I think from a psychological perspective, most people would accept it if it's going to be life-saving for them.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah, for sure. Like, I mean it's like a life or death situation.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> I remember we had a survey, we actually got a group of ministers and church ministers to come and discuss with them. And this was in Alabama and you know, the black church in the Southern states was very strong, the Southern Baptist church was a very strong influence on the black population there. And I remember one of the reverends said that he said his ultimate aim was to get to heaven, but he wasn't in any hurry. And so he, if we offered him a pig organ transplant, he'd take the pig organ transplant to keep him here a bit longer. So even with very religious faith, people still said, yes, if it's going to keep me alive I'll go for it.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah, I mean, because as well, we have like this yuck factor, right from like the sociological part of like the pig. You know, like this kind of, oh, it's still kind of disgusting, like the way to say of an animal and, but I understand like people would like totally for sure like life or death situation would agree with the fact that why would they not do it. I think I asked you this already, but to what extent it's possible to break the immunological barrier by putting the human DNA in the pig, but you already mentioned this, do you think that in the future we will have no immunological response or how are you working on this?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> It's gonna take a few years to not need to give any drugs in expressive drugs because we've gotta adapt the pig more manipulations to the pig. And that always takes time. But I think eventually we'll get to the point. We need very little immunosuppressive therapy if any. The other important, interesting thing is that we have done this in the past. You can put an immunosuppressive drug into the pig. So the pig actually makes the drug. You put the genes for certain drugs, not all drugs, but someone, but some immunosuppressive drugs. And we did this in some pigs some years ago, and the pigs made so much of this drug that it suppressed themselves and they got susceptible to infections. So they didn't live a long life. But we've now got techniques where instead of putting this gene into the whole pig, so the whole pig is making the stroke. You could put the gene just into the organ you wanted, or just into the eyelids you want. So only those would make the drug. So in the pig, it would be a small amount, but when you take that organ out and put it into the patient, it may make enough drugs that you don't have to give the patient any immunosuppressive injections or, or tablets. So there are all sorts of ways we can do this over the next 20 years. I'm sure we'll explore those. And that means the patient will have to have lesser immuno-suppression therapy. And so, because the pig organ will be making it for them or something like that. And there are techniques too. Now you can actually if you give a patient an antibiotic, a certain antibiotic, it will switch on a gene that they've got there, or it will switch it off. So you could put a gene into the pig to make this drug, but unless you take the antibiotic, you're not gonna make the drug. You're not gonna make it, it's not actually gonna produce it and then if you're producing too much, you can stop the antibiotic again and it'll stop producing it. So there are ways we can manipulate how much the level of drug was being produced.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> You know, so this is kind of new, or the most revolutionary new thing that you are working on with xenotransplantation, right?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Yes.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Are there any other techniques or technologies that are involved in the new research or like the research that is being contacted at the moment?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Well, one other area, which is a similar area is that if you have a patient who's had to say a heart or human heart transplant or a kidney transplant, or even some people who've just through pregnancies or from blood transfusions, they have made antibodies against other humans. And if in those patients, you can have actually a hundred percent antibodies against anybody, any donor, these people have antibodies. So if you put a pig, if you put a human organ from a donor into that patient, it may immediately reject it just like it would reject a pig organ. And those patients are very difficult to treat because you can't find a human organ that's suitable for them. Maybe they're 95% sensitized. That means they have antibodies and 95% of the community, maybe once a year, you'll have a donor somewhere who might be suitable for them that they're not gonna reject immediately. Now pigs, again, some people have, most, everybody has some antibodies against pigs, but what you can do is you can change the structure of these antigens on the pig cell. And that means that those patients no longer have antibodies against the pig. And if you are, if you have antibodies against humans, some of those cross-react with pigs so that you not only reject the human organ, you'll reject the pig organ. But if you manipulate the pig and take away those targets for those antibodies, the patient will no longer reject that pig organ. It'll still reject the human organ because you've still got the targets there but on the pig organ. So you can manipulate the pig to suit that particular patient. And so there are all sorts of potential ways that eventually pig organs will probably be much better than human organs for the majority of patients.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> The other thing is we keep and we are breeding the pigs in very clean facilities so that they won't carry any infections with them. The staff who look after them put on a sort of space suit every day so they don't give the pig any infections for themselves. The pigs are tested every month to make sure they've not got any infectious organisms that you could transfer with the graft. Whereas most humans, human donors, you, come into hospital, they're set to be brained. You have literally a few hours to check. Are they carrying any infectious organisms or not? And many major infections have been transferred from donors and human donors to the patients. You know, HIV was transferred in the past, hepatitis transferred, all sorts of things. And there are some viruses like cytomegalovirus, which almost everybody carries and so you're always transferring your cytomegalovirus.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b>  What's the name of it?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> It's called cytomegalovirus. It's a very common virus. It doesn't usually cause a lot of problems for anybody unless you are immunosuppressed. And then your response to it just like your response to coronavirus, the COVID virus is obviously weak. And so then it can cause the problem. So in patients with a kidney transplant, if you transfer cytomegalovirus with it, even if the patient themselves has had cytomegalovirus in the past you transfer a new strain of cytomegalovirus, you even express the patient with the drugs you're giving and then the patient can get sick with his virus. This new virus they're exposed to. Now pigs should be free of all these viruses because that's part of the plan of breeding in these clean facilities. They're not infected with anything that they can transfer. That's the aid eventually.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah. They're isolated and just like very well.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> They'll be isolated in this facility until you remove their organs. The other thing to look at is we, in the United States, we kill well over a hundred million pigs each year for food. So it's not as if we are doing something really weird because we've been killing pigs for centuries to eat. And if you go to a commercial pig breeding facility, the conditions are not very good. Whereas these pigs will be housed under very clean, ideal conditions, given the perfect diet. And instead of being slaughtered by having their throats cut or something, they will be anaesthetized and they will die under the anaesthesia when you're taking the organs out. So from a pig's point of view, it's a much more humane life and what you mean by life and death than it is for the average pig.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yes.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> So I don't think from an ethical perspective where you could criticize what these pigs will go through.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> No, I mean, it's like a horrible death instead of, you know, like you cannot compare it at all with like slaughterhouses and this.
<br><br>
<b>BS:</b> No, I don't think so. I don't think so.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> That is great.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Going back to the busy patients who are waiting, say for a kidney transplant on dialysis, when they are put on the waiting list, they're usually told this, you gotta wait for a donor. It may take some time. It may take some years even. But you just have to be patient until you get the donor organ.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yes.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> What they're not told because it would depress them too much, I think is that within five years, nearly half of them will be dead or not suitable for a transplant anymore.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Five years.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> You tell them that because it's too depressing for them, but if you told them that, I think they'd be much more ready than to say, well, maybe I could have a pig kidney instead because I don't wanna wait till I'm gonna be dead or wait till I'm no longer suitable for transplant. I'd rather take my chance with this pig organ. And so I think when you explain to the patient in detail what their long-term prospect is, which I say, I don't think we do at the minute because we don't want to depress them, but then I think they'd be much more ready to say, well, I'll try the pig organ.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> For sure. Like but so you said like, after five years in the United States, people are too old?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> On the waiting list for a human organ donor organ and you are on dialysis within five years, 45% of the patients on that waiting list will either have died or would be taken off the list because they're no longer suitable for a transplant. They're too fragile or what it is. So nearly half of them are taken off within six years. And so I don't think most people waiting have realized that that's their outlook. They think I've just gotta be patient, I'll get an organ eventually, but they don't realize that they may get too sick, too weak to have a transplant.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> This is great. I actually think it's amazing. You, all the research that you're doing and how it makes you, you know, makes you think like how we can keep on having a life. And it's awesome. In my mind what's the body configuration, do you think it is generated based on a Xenotransplanted person? Like, you know from like, you know, medical or transplantology perspective or point of view?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Well, I think probably every patient will look at this rather differently. Some people will say, I don't care if it's a pig organ or what it is, you know, I'm fine. Just go ahead. I want to stay alive. Other people will have some reservations about it. They think of, well, I, I don't want to be a timer, as you say, I don't want to be part pig. What would other people think of me? Or is it my child? Who's gonna have this Pig heart transplant. What will people think about the child? Will they be bullied? Will they be considered different Cetera, Cetera? So I think everybody will have different views on it, but I think the majority when it comes back to what am I gonna be alive or dead, or is my child gonna be alive or dead? I think they come down on the side of wanting to be alive. And so they would say, well, I'll accept these psychological or social problems. Just because I think it's more important to be alive. And I suppose really with children you don't necessarily need to tell people you've got a pig organ. And so it's only if you let people know you have... if you don't tell the child, the child can't tell anybody else and adults you may certainly hear that an adult had a pig organ. And I think the majority of people will be interested in you because you're a little different and it just depends on how you will feel about it. And if you have a supportive family, I'm sure, and you'll come to terms with it, even if you have reservations initially just because you're alive and well. And so that's the key to life, of course. So I think it'll be okay.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah, of course. Like it's very subjective is a very controversial topic of course. And the very, like, you know, depends on the cultural or sociological kind of the point of view that to take it. But yeah, it's very interesting.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> The other thing is there will be improvements over the next 20 years regarding immunosuppressant drug therapy. For example, at the minute you're gonna do a human heart, or kidney transplant. Usually, you give two or three drugs up front as a sort of loading shot to weaken the immune system. And then you give the patient daily drugs to keep the immune system suppressed. So you've got two or three drugs up front and you've got two or three drugs that they get every day. My colleagues here have got a new drug and we test its monkeys. You give this single drug, you have to give it by injection of the minute. It's the only available injection. You give it on the day of the transplant. And then basically you give one injection weekly for the next year. One injection of this single drug once a week, no other drugs at all. And those monkeys with heart-kidney transplants are staying a hundred per cent. Well, they're not rejecting at all. Now. That's quite a big change from giving three drugs upfront and three drugs every day. So inexpressive if therapy is slowly getting better and better and better as new drugs are discovered or developed and so on. And I'm using this same drug now with baboons with pig kidney transplants. I haven't done enough yet to know if it's gonna be as successful as with human transplants, but we're getting better and better drugs. And this drug, for example, if you stop it after say six months, you don't give anymore, it takes two or three months for the baboon to reject that or the monkey to reject the organ transport. So you could probably give it once every two weeks or every four weeks for up to six months. And they probably would do well. So we are coming down to the point now that they don't need a lot of inexpressive therapy. The other thing is, that I can't see any side effects from the injection drug. They don't get hypertension, they don't get diabetes, and they don't get this. They're probably more susceptible to infection just as anybody, whose immune system is suppressed, but we're getting better and better drugs and that will make the results of xenotransplantation better and better as we go up as well as the pig, the big, better pig. So I expect in 20 or 30 years, it'll become very common, very commonplace to have a pig organ transplant and just take a drug once a week or something. So you're gonna get a lot of improvements.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> And just one question, like, because if we're talking about genetics from what I understood, like from the previous research that I did, like if you, I don't know, targets like how can I say it? Reproductive cells, as you can, you know, like the generations after can be, have mutations or other kinds of genetic material changes. I don't know, based on what you have, right. If you're a parent. So if you actually become a Chimera having pig DNA in yourself, can that somehow get into reproductive cells?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> No the FDA and the regulated authorities one of the strictest things is that you have to be sure that you are not going to pass on these pig genes to your offspring.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Oh yeah. That's super important.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> So that means you can't manipulate the reproductive cells and they also, you can't change the brain cells. You can't have either the pig being made more intelligent or the human may be less. So those things are sort of built into the system. And if you're just transplanting an organ, like a heart or something, there's no risk of that happening. Now the other thing about it is that because there are viruses or particles of viruses in every pig cell, these so-called porcine retroviruses We have PERVs yeah. We have human endogenous retroviruses in our cells, very similar to the pig’s ones, but obviously different. And they don't seem to do us any harm. And the big ones don't seem to do the pig any harm, but people are worried the pig ones do the human harm when they get into the human. And there's no evidence that they will do any harm, but still, it's unknown. Of course, the company, one of the companies I'm working with now has pigs, they've knocked out all of these viruses. So the pig no longer has these viruses. And so there's no risk of those viruses being transferred to the human recipient. And so that gets around that problem. But there has been a lot of concern about it, whether the pig viruses could cause any problems for the human<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> We don't know how long term this would work.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> And I think when they've knocked it out of one pig, the offspring of that pig would obviously not carry that virus. And so you are gonna breed a herd of pigs that don't have that virus in them anymore.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> And one more question, because the organs that grow in the host, in the pigs, at what speed do they grow?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> You're talking about the growth of the pig or the pig organ.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Aha.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> It's been known for a long time that when you put a pig organ into a monkey or baboon for at least the first few months, it grows as if it's still in the pig. The pig says it grows very rapidly, much more rapidly than a monkey. The monkey might put on a couple of kilograms in the year. The pig will put on 50 kilograms in the year, and this does cause some problems, not so much with the kidney because you've got quite a bit of space in the abdomen, so that if the pig kidney doubles in size, which it does usually within about three months after that, it seems to level out a bit. It doesn't grow so fast, but you've got space in the abdomen for the pig kidney to double in size in three months without causing a lot of problems. But when you put a pig heart into the chest and that doubles in size in the first three months, that can cause problems because the heart can be compressed in the chest, because there's much less room in the chest. And so that is something that we've known about for some time. And one of the companies has knocked out the genes for growth hormone receptors so that the pig itself will grow more slowly when you transport an organ from that pig to the baboon or the monkey or the patient, that organ will grow much more slowly than if it was a normal pig.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> So you like, you have control over the growth, but like, is it the ones that you have once you like take it or remove it from the pig? does it stop growing or<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> No, it will still grow when you take it from the pig, they still grow. It must be something inherent in the organ that keeps it growing at least for a few months. Then I say it levels out of it. Maybe it's still susceptible to pig growth hormone until that's used up. And then it's less susceptible to a baboon. I dunno what it is. So but of course, there are lots of miniature pigs around. There are lots of breeds of miniature pigs that don't grow. Some don't even grow more than 25 kilograms in their lifetime. As adults, others grow up to, you know, 200 pounds instead of a thousand pounds like the ordinary pig would do. And so the other company I'm working with, they're using the basic pig as the miniature pig, which will never grow more than about 200 pounds. So those pigs, the organs grow much more slowly, of course, than they would if they were from a normal pig. So when you transplant those organs, there's very little rapid growth of those organs. They grow at more or less the same speed as the monkey organs grow so it doesn't become a problem. So the various ways of dealing with this problem are to genetically knock out the growth hormone receptors. The other is just to choose a different sort of pig as your background. So but the other thing is if we want the organ to do everything that a human organ would do of course we want the pig organ. If it's a kidney, we want it to get rid of waste materials and all that sort of stuff. The most complex organ from a metabolic or functional point of view, of course, is the liver. The liver makes about 2000 different products that we use in our body all sorts of enzymes, hormones, etcetera. And so well, maybe the pig liver won't make all the same things as the human liver does. And we don't know that yet because we haven't had pig livers surviving long enough in baboons to know whether they do that. But if you have a deficiency, let's say you are not making a certain protein sufficiently well by the pig liver, you could genetically engineer that pig to make the human protein. And so you could solve the functional problems as well as the immunological problems through genetic engineering. So it's an almost unlimited field where you can change the pig to suit what you want,<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Twitching, designing the donor.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Yes, that's right<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> From a genetic basis.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Now we know, for example, that pig kidneys have kept monkeys alive for over three years. And so they must be doing all the things you want to keep a healthy person alive. So we know from the kidney and the heart that they're probably doing functionally, they're doing okay, but we don't know about the liver yet or other organs, but we can genetically manipulate the pig if we needed to offset a deficiency. Or if there's too much of something, we can knock it out. So again, it's quite a huge potential for the future.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b>  So the heart is the organ that is the best of the best of the organs to transplant from a pig to a human?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> Did you say, is the heart the best? Well my colleagues at the University of Maryland and you've probably read in.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Like David Bennett's.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> With a heart transplant yeah. With a pig heart transplant. He wasn't the best patient for that. They chose the wrong patient. I think he was too sick, I think at the time. And I think that's why he died eventually because he never really recovered from the operation and so on. And he had a lot of health problems, which I think they made a mistake. It should have chosen somebody who was a likely candidate to stay alive. The pig heart is a really simple organ, and it doesn't have the range of cells that the kidney has. And so in some ways the immune response to it is rather weaker than it is to the kidney. But when you put a pig heart in, you're gonna put it in because there's no other treatment, you can't get a human heart. It's not suitable for an assist device or a mechanical heart for some reason or other. So that's why you're gonna say, we'll put in a Pig heart. There's no alternative. That means if a pig's heart fails, he's dead because you've already ruled out all the alternatives. My feeling is that the first trials should really be in patients who need a kidney because we've already said a lot of them are never gonna get a kidney transplant. So they have the opportunity to stay on dialysis, but it's not a very good lifestyle. And if the kidney fails, the pig kidney fails, they can go back on dialysis. And they just cut their losses. And as long as you make that decision early enough, I mean, if you keep on treating the patient for rejection and especially more and more, they're eventually gonna get an infection or something, and then they're gonna die. But if you say, well, we've given a lot of antirejection therapy, it hasn't had the effect we want therefore let's stop everything, take the kidney out, put it back onto dialysis. Let's cut our losses at this point and keep the patient alive. If you are sensible like that, you could save that patient's life. If you're not too ambitious. And so I think there is that safeguard with the patients having a kidney but we don't have that option with the heart. So that's why I think the kidney would be the right first group. The only exception I think is these babies who need a heart transplant because they've got really no alternative. They can't have an assist device. They kind of, this they're not gonna do well. So in those cases, you just have to try it. But again, it's still a temporary thing. You're trying to keep them alive until they get that human<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Yeah. I mean, as I have always heard, like in the news sometimes, like I don't know, family, saying like, oh my God, I'm praying for another child's heart. Because I want to save my child. And it's quite a little bit weird that you're expecting another child to die so your child keeps living. I don't know. It's a bit weird.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> But it gets around that ethical dilemma too. Somebody else died. That's right.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Right. I mean, somebody has to die. So it's weird, but like this, this would actually resolve all of this and then you don't have to get rid of the organ shortage.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> And the other thing to bear in mind is that with transplants of every organ, big human organs liver, kidneys hearts, lungs, and so on because of the shortage of these organs, we've over the last 10 or 20 years, we've been using organs that we would never have used 20 years ago that because we would have said 20 years ago said these organs are very poor organs. They're borderline, we don't wanna transport that organ, but now we're talking about borderline organs because we're so short of them. So we're actually putting the patients at increased risk really by using organs that are just about gonna keep them alive, but not enough Because we're so short of organs. And we think, well, rather than letting the patient die, we'll try this organ. With the pig, we should have perfectly good organs all the time. And so we, you know, from an ethical perspective, we should be doing better for the patient. If, as long as the organ is gonna survive and function, normally then we will with human organs added to which we're not gonna be transferring infectious organisms that we do from them. Some of these patients know that they have a heart attack and drop dead and they brush him to hospital and they realize they can't resuscitate him. So they call in the transplant people and the transplant people say, okay, well, his kidneys will probably still be okay to transplant, even though they've had no blood supply, no oxygen for an hour or so. We take that as a risk. You obviously have very no time to decide. Is that patient carrying any microorganism? Has he got an infection? So he is gonna transfer. Because we don't have time to do all these tests. So we are actually putting the recipient at increasing risk. First of all, he's got an organ that's not perfect because it's had no option for<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> No testing…<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> And we don't know if it's carrying an infection, etcetera. So we're putting him at increasing risk just because we're so short of organs, that won't be the case with the pig, because you'll know ahead of time what pig you are going to use whether it has got an infection, etcetera, etcetera. So eventually it'll be a huge step forward.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> This is great. Well, I think I have actually asked you everything and you said more than I, I actually wanted to know like that's great. But would you actually like to add anything that you think is important for me to know?<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> I think so. I think we've covered most of the topics I think are important. If I think of anything, I'll send you an email. But I think we've covered pretty well now whether we've covered your basic premise as to whether this is gonna affect people's consideration of themselves as a person, if they've got a pig organ or they may have more than one pig organ, they may pig up lungs or something. I don't think they will. I think they wish to stay alive more or less, it takes precedence over almost everything else in patients. And they'll accept the doubts they have in their mind if they know it's the only way they can stay alive. And so I think it outdoes everything else. But they may still have some deep-seated concerns that they're not entirely human. Now they've got some pig organs in, but we can always reassure them that the pig organ has some human genes in it, so that's not bad, you know? But yeah. So it's an interesting topic. What you are looking at is people's attitudes to their own bodies. And obviously, it takes many different roles. I dunno if you're looking at young girls who wanna stay thin and all this sort of stuff because they think that's what's social.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> The social construction of the body.<br><br>

<b>BS:</b> As well. Yeah. Yeah. And this is an offshoot of that really. So it's quite an interesting topic. Okay. Okay. I will, if I think of anything else, I'll send you an email and I will get this to you somehow before the end of this week.<br><br>

<b>SdJ:</b> Thank you so much for your time.<br><br>
